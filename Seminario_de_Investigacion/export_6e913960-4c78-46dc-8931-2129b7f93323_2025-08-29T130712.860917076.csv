The new concept of vertical axis wind turbine with variable opening blades is presented as an innovative prototype where mechanical details are important for the natural control of the openings of the blades. Theoretical, numerical and experimental analyzes are performed in the turbine called DEC® with the aim of determining the aerodynamic characteristics. An analysis of the behavior of the DEC® turbine consists of a numerical study carried out to calculate or drag coefficient, considering a range of opening positions of the opening at each moment to determine the power coefficient. A second numerical approach is to analyze the moment caused by the interaction between all the turbine blades, in which the effects of energy dissipation caused by the flow mats are considered. Then, the theoretical, numerical results are validated by tests performed using a model in the open wind tunnel, where the prototype is subjected to different wind speeds while maintaining rotation control. Suggestions are made to improve the mechanical and aerodynamic design of the innovative prototype. Finally, the DEC® turbine is expected to serve as an inspiration for creating other mechanical forms of passive or active control to improve variable aerodynamics applied in low-speed conditions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Articulated Blade; Cfd; Experimental Test; Power Coefficient; Vawt","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125057860"

This is experimentally compared with the performance of a correspondingly sized Bach-type Savonius turbine using the same electrical generator and measurement instrumentation in a wind tunnel. Experiments were performed for Reynolds numbers, based on blade chord, in the range 5 × 103 to 1 × 105, and for blade settings between −40° and +40o. The study shows that for the tip speed ratios that have been investigated, the Farrah vertical axis wind turbine design can only marginally outperform a corresponding two-bladed Bach-type Savonius turbine and then only when its blades are set to 40° pitch angle. The presence of a small inner cylinder, which rotates with the turbine, does not enhance its performance due to the fact that it is immersed in an extensive column of relatively static air. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aerodynamics; Farrah Turbine; Savonius Turbine; Vertical Axis Wind Turbine; Reynolds Number; Wind Tunnels; Wind Turbines; Electrical Generators; Experimental Investigations; Measurement Instrumentation; Savonius Turbine; Tip Speed Ratio; Variable Blades; Variable Geometry; Vertical Axis Wind Turbines; Turbomachine Blades; Aerodynamics; Geometry; Numerical Model; Wind Farm; Wind Turbine","Reynolds number; Wind tunnels; Wind turbines; Electrical generators; Experimental investigations; Measurement instrumentation; Savonius turbine; Tip speed ratio; Variable blades; Variable geometry; Vertical axis wind turbines; Turbomachine blades; aerodynamics; geometry; numerical model; wind farm; wind turbine","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087981497"

Numerous investigations were carried out to face this problem. In the present paper, a new idea of the Savonius turbine with a variable geometry of blades is proposed. Its blades, made of elastic material, were continuously deformed during the rotor revolution to increase a positive torque of the advancing blade and to decrease a negative torque of the returning blade. In order to assess the turbine aerodynamic performance, a two-dimensional numerical model was developed. The fluid-structure interaction (FSI) method was applied where blade deformations were defined by computational solid mechanics (CSM) simulations, whereas computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations allowed for transient flow prediction. The influence of the deformation magnitude and the position of maximally deformed blades with respect to the incoming wind direction were studied. The aerodynamic performance increased with an increase in the deformation magnitude. The power coefficient exceeded Cp = 0.30 for the eccentricity magnitude of 10% and reached 0.39 for the highest magnitude under study. It corresponded to 90% improvement in comparison to Cp = 0.21 in the case of the fixed-shape Savonius turbine. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blade Load; Computational Fluid Dynamics (cfd); Deformable Blades; Fluid-structure Interaction (fsi); Power Coefficient; Savonius Turbine; Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (vawt); Aerodynamics; Computational Fluid Dynamics; Deformation; Fluid Structure Interaction; Aero-dynamic Performance; Computational Fluid Dynamics Simulations; Computational Solid Mechanics; Deformation Magnitude; Numerical Investigations; Savonius Wind Turbine; Turbine Aerodynamics; Two Dimensional Numerical Models; Turbomachine Blades","Aerodynamics; Computational fluid dynamics; Deformation; Fluid structure interaction; Aero-dynamic performance; Computational fluid dynamics simulations; Computational solid mechanics; Deformation magnitude; Numerical investigations; Savonius wind turbine; Turbine aerodynamics; Two dimensional numerical models; Turbomachine blades","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089817818"

The results were presented in the form of (Cp) curves as a function of tip speed ratio (λ0). The aerodynamic mathematical mode called ""multi-streamtube"" was implemented. To determine the Cp(λ0) of the Parabolic rotor, regardless of its engineering shape, a computer program has been prepared by using Microsoft Visual Basic. The geometrical design parameters covered in this study are rotor blades number (N), rotor height (h) or (2H), rotor diameter (2R) and chord line (C). Whereas, through these parameters a total of 57 configurations were utilized and adopted. Thus, this number of different designs was sufficient to identify the performance behaviors of the Parabolic wind rotor. Accordingly, the results indicated that increasing rotor height to diameter ratio (H/R) leads to a decrease in Cp over low tip speed ratio range for all values of solidity, σ, (NC/R) investigated. However, higher values of (H/R) result in a raise in Cp over high tip speed ratio range for values of (NC/R) less than 0.2 approximately. Thus, it seems that higher (H/R) values constitute an advantage for fast rotating rotors (low (NC/R) and high tip speed ratio). © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aerodynamic Performance; Parabolic Wind Rotor; Vawt; Geometry; Vertical Axis Wind Turbine; Visual Basic; Aero-dynamic Performance; Design Parameters; Geometrical Designs; Parabolic Wind Rotor; Parabolics; Power Coefficients; Tip Speed Ratio; Variable Geometry; Vawt; Wind Rotor; Aerodynamics","Geometry; Vertical axis wind turbine; Visual BASIC; Aero-dynamic performance; Design parameters; Geometrical designs; Parabolic wind rotor; Parabolics; Power coefficients; Tip speed ratio; Variable geometry; VAWT; Wind rotor; Aerodynamics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085163406"
