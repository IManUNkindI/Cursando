AB  - Accurately and rapidly detecting damage to wind turbine blades is critical for ensuring the safe operation of wind turbines. Current deep learning-based detection methods predominantly employ the gathered blade images directly for damage detection. However, due to the slender geometry of wind turbine blades, non-blade background information accounts for a considerable proportion of the captured images with complex background features, affecting the detection of blade damage. To address this challenge, we propose a novel edge cropping method combined with an enhanced YOLOv5s network for detecting damage in wind turbine blades, termed Edge Crop and Enhanced YOLOv5 (EC–EY). The edge cropping method adaptively modifies the cropping stride by the edge features of both sides of the blade, thereby procuring image content that predominantly encompasses the blade region. This procedure effectively mitigates the interference from complex background features and augments the utilization of image pixels. Furthermore, the enhanced YOLOv5 network incorporates the global attention mechanism into the head section of the network and substitutes the original SPPF module with an attention-based intra-scale feature interaction module. The EC–EY aims to improve the detection accuracy for small and variable-shape damages in wind turbine blades. EC–EY achieved excellent performance on a dataset of wind turbine blade damage collected in western Inner Mongolia. Notably, the edge cropping method significantly improves the accuracy of wind turbine blade damage detection. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With the increasing demand for renewable energy, the deployment of wind turbines (WTs) in mountainous areas has surged, raising concerns about the associated seismic risk. The seismic fragility of these turbines is governed by a combination of factors, including the characteristics of the seismic source, the propagation paths, and the site-specific conditions. However, there is limited understanding of how these coupled source-path-site effects impact WT fragility, creating a critical knowledge gap that impedes the development of reliable seismic design guidelines for wind farms in mountainous areas. To address this issue, a physics-based method for fragility assessment is proposed, combining scenario-specific ground motion simulations with a hybrid semi-analytical-numerical modeling approach. This methodology integrates three computational components: (i) the frequency-wavenumber (FK) technique to compute the semi-analytical Green's function for a semi-infinite crustal space, (ii) the spectral element method (SEM) for efficient wavefield simulations in heterogeneous terrains, and (iii) the finite element method (FEM) for detailed nonlinear modeling of WT structural responses. The FK-SEM-FEM framework enables end-to-end simulation of seismic wave propagation from fault rupture to the nonlinear structural response of the WTs. The study analyzes the effects of key parameters on the seismic performance of WTs in mountainous regions, and introduces, for the first time, a fragility model for WTs considering diverse mountain geometries. The results indicate that the seismic response of WTs on mountaintops can be amplified by 1.16–3.02 times compared to those at the base. The combined effect of fault rupture mode and local site effects leads to spatially variable damage patterns, making WTs on mountaintops more susceptible to failure. The findings reveal that current seismic design codes for WTs in mountainous areas are inadequate, highlighting the need for immediate updates to address these risks. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Many engineering structures, such as the wings and blades of wind turbines, are made of composite materials. These structures are more prone to geometric nonlinear deformations during working conditions, which can affect their performance and even lead to damage. Monitoring deformation is important for these structures. However, existing shape sensing approaches typically require additional kinematic variables to describe cross-sectional warping deformations and are limited to small deformations. Therefore, in this study, a novel shape sensing method for reconstructing the geometric nonlinear deformations of multilayer composite beams is developed. The proposed approach focuses on utilizing rotation angles as key variables to accurately represent the nonlinear deformations of a beam under various loading conditions. The method involves effectively calculating the rotation angle of composite beams by establishing a least squares functional that relates the theoretical curvature to the measured curvature. Using geometric relationships, the deformed shape can be predicted. Numerical analyses demonstrate that the reconstruction method has high accuracy and stability for various loading scenarios and composite materials. The advantages of the method include its simplicity and independence from prior knowledge of material properties and external load information, which highlights its strong potential for practical engineering applications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - As the crucial equipment for renewable energy power generation, wind turbines always work under variable operating conditions, making it difficult to identify potential failures promptly. Drivetrain system is the guarantee for reliable and safe operations of wind turbines, but drivetrain fault diagnostics under variable operating conditions remains a challenging problem for diagnostics and maintenance of wind turbines. This paper proposes a novel order spectrum-assisted sparse learning classification (OS-SLC) approach for wind turbine drivetrain fault diagnostics under variable operating conditions. First, order tracking is incorporated into signal feature pre-extraction for order spectrum dictionary design initialization. Then, dictionary learning is developed to excavate latent features within order spectra, facilitating effective sparse representations of various health status. Subsequently, the order spectral sparse representation classification strategy based on minimum sparse approximation error is developed, which enables robust fault diagnosis without any discriminative classifier models. Experiment results from transfer diagnosis tasks of wind turbine drivetrain datasets under variable operating conditions verify that the proposed OS-SLC approach shows remarkable diagnostic accuracy comparable to mainstream domain adaptation methods, whilst demonstrating the diagnostic robustness against noises and hyper-parameters. By integrating order tracking with sparse representation learning, our proposed approach demonstrates the potential for fault diagnosis under nonstationary conditions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study investigates the aerodynamic effects of bio-inspired leading edge modifications on the NREL Phase VI horizontal-axis wind turbine using Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) simulations. Three leading edge geometries—sinusoidal wavy, segmented arc, and spherical tubercles—were evaluated under both full-span and partial-span configurations. A parametric analysis of the sinusoidal design was conducted using both constant and variable amplitudes within a dimensionless amplitude range (Ā = 0.015–0.045), with a fixed wavelength ratio (λ/c = 0.15). The variable amplitude configuration with Ā = 0.03 demonstrated the best performance, increasing torque by approximately 7 % at the rated wind speed (10 m/s) while maintaining stable output across the entire operating range. Both the segmented arc and variable sinusoidal designs consistently improved torque across all wind speeds. In contrast, the spherical tubercle design enhanced performance only at high wind speeds (V<inf>∞</inf> >15 m/s), with reduced efficiency at lower speeds. Implementation strategy significantly influenced performance, partial-span modifications preserved tip-flow stability and improved low-to-moderate-speed efficiency. In contrast, full-span designs improved high-speed performance by expanding low-pressure regions and suppressing flow separation, albeit with a reduction in efficiency at rated wind speeds. These findings offer practical guidance for aerodynamic optimization of wind turbine blades via biomimetic design. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study explores the effect of variations in blade angle (α) and length at a fixed radius (r) on the aerodynamic performance of Archimedes Spiral Wind Turbines (ASWT), with the aim of enhancing their adaptability and efficiency in variable urban wind conditions. To identify the most effective blade design approach, two parametric methodologies were evaluated within the same dimensional range to maximize the power coefficient (C<inf>P</inf>), where (i) an unconstrained parametric study (FM), in which both blade angle and blade length (L) were allowed to vary simultaneously without geometric constraints, and (ii) a geometrically constrained parametric study (SM), in which blade length (L) was held constant while blade angle was adjusted. The results revealed that the SM approach outperformed the FM approach, with a 6.7 % increase in C<inf>P</inf> over the reference model (0.22), demonstrating higher aerodynamic efficiency, greater flexibility in blade angle and length adjustment, and deeper insights into the effects of geometric parameters. Based on this methodology, 36 ASWT blade models were designed using SolidWorks 2020 and analyzed using 3D simulations conducted in ANSYS CFX-2020 R2. The power coefficient (C<inf>P</inf>), relative to the tip speed ratio (TSR), was employed as the performance metric to assess the performance of each model. The analysis identified SM-23 as the most efficient model, with an L of 140 mm and a blade angle of800. At a wind speed of 10 m/s, this model achieved a maximum C<inf>P</inf> of 0.265, representing a 14.67 % improvement over the reference model. These findings highlight the potential of refined ASWT blade designs to enhance performance and support sustainable urban wind energy solutions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cavity resonances in ducts are a classical problem that has involved researchers from very different fields over time. More recently, the aerospace community became engaged again due to resonances found within the flow path of aero-engines, for example, in bleed cavities in the low-pressure compressor section. These resonances can lead to problems with the structural integrity of upstream components and thus warrant investigation. This study expands the previous dataset of an open box cavity with variable depth (D) and a rectangular opening with length (L), effectively testing L/D=[4,2,1/2]ratios. This parameter was indicated by Rossiter to be a strong predictive parameter in frequency generation. This article compares the results of the same cavity geometry within two wind tunnels of different dimensions and operational setups. The intention of the study is to isolate the Rossiter modes from any other geometric modes that are due to the wind tunnel's test section geometry. This isolation allows the modification of the model of Rossiter and the cavity depth model of East to improve the predictive capability over a larger range of Mach numbers and for deeper cavities. One wind tunnel has an open loop continuous flow operation where the Mach number is set by changing the outlet static pressure. The second wind tunnel has a blowdown operation where both Mach and Reynolds numbers can be set independently by pulling a downstream vacuum and setting the upstream total pressure. The experiments were performed for an operating range from low subsonic to transonic Mach numbers. The analysis focuses on modifying the constants in both the Rossiter model and the cavity depth model proposed by East along with investigating the phenomenon of mode switching for Rossiter modes. The analyses show a good repeatability of the dataset between the two wind tunnels displaying strong resonances at similar operating points. The new proposed constants for the Rossiter model when using an L/D=2 are γ=0.15 and κ=0.58. For the deeper cavity with L/D=0.5, the constants proposed are γ=0.15 and κ=0.9. The modification of the cavity depth model by East to better predict the mode above Mach 0.3 is proposed by adjusting the constant B=2.5 and leaving A=0.65. An independence from Reynolds number of the acoustic frequency generation is demonstrated within the operating range. A mode-switching behavior is identified with the shallowest and deepest cavity showing multiple mode transitions within the operating range and a near constant Rossiter mode 1 for L/D=2. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Despite significant progress in floating offshore wind turbine (FOWT) technology, there are still several challenges, including the design of a cost-effective system. Considerable research has been dedicated to optimizing the floating platform geometry, layout, dimensions, and weight over the past few years, with some focusing on semisubmersible platforms, where steel is often used for both the platform and the tower. However, concrete FOWTs may be more cost-effective and reduce carbon footprint. Other areas requiring further research include the impact of the tower material, the maximum inclination angle, and confining ballast water within dimensionally variable compartments during optimization. The study aims to address these points through a hydrostatic optimization of a novel 15 MW concrete semisubmersible FOWT using a genetic algorithm method. The results show that the platform mass reduction for pitch angles larger than 6∘ is lower compared to that for angles smaller than 6∘ regardless of the tower material. Moreover, confining the ballast water inside dimensionally variable compartments leads to a lower semisubmersible platform weight. Finally, an initial comparison of raw material costs shows that a concrete platform with a steel tower offers the most cost-effective solution compared to a FOWT entirely made from steel or concrete. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The fatigue life of welded connections in structures is normally calculated from bi-linear S-N curves presented in design standards, one part S-N curve for the largest stress ranges that can be determined from constant amplitude testing to the left of the fatigue limit and one part S-N curve for stress ranges lower than the fatigue limit that can be determined from variable amplitude fatigue testing. The second curve is governing the calculated fatigue damage for typical long-term stress distributions for marine structures subjected to cyclic loads from wind and waves. In this study fracture mechanics analyses are performed in a relative way to reduce much of the uncertainties present in such analyses to estimate a second part of the S-N curve as function of fatigue crack growth parameters, threshold stress intensity factor, geometry functions and the long-term stress range distribution. The analysis methodology is calibrated to fatigue test data from constant amplitude loading. Based on the performed analyses it is shown that the second part of the design S-N curve for as-welded butt welds can be lifted to a higher level than presented in design standards of today. For structures supporting wind turbines where the Fatigue Limit State is governing design, this may result in reduction in steel weight as compared with existing design S-N curves in standards. This information may also be useful for lifetime extension of existing structures. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The push to attain commercialization of the floating offshore wind industry and subsequently achieving net-zero carbon emission by the year 2050 requires the utilization of cutting-edge design and analyses techniques. Geometric design parameterization and optimization is an effective technique that can be employed in modelling and optimizing a Floating Offshore Wind Turbine (FOWT) substructure. It is an essential framework with the capability of innovative concept generation of platform types in the FEED design phase. This study addresses the conceptual design shape generation, multidisciplinary design analysis and optimization (MDAO) of spar variants FOWT substructure developed from the standard NREL OC3 spar. The methodology involves the use of non-uniform rational basis spline (NURBS) parameterization technique to generate design variants with the flexibility of varying the control points to facilitate varying geometric shapes due to the local propagation property of the NURBS curve. Design variables passed through the NURBS curves control points generates a robust and rich design space and the potential flow hydrodynamic analysis tool in the DNV SESAM suite is used to estimate the hydrodynamic response. The design and analysis phases are explored and exploited for optimal design solution based on specified objectives and constraints with the use of state-of-the-art derivative-free optimizers. The optimal designs were evaluated for three sets of FOWT static pitch angle constraints (5, 7 and 10) degrees, a positive ballast constraint for stability and a constraint on nacelle acceleration root mean square (RMS) value below 30 % of the gravitational acceleration. The single objective function considered in the study is to ensure a minimum mass of the steel material utilized in the design, which invariably leads to a reduction in cost of the substructure material used in fabrication. Achieving this single objective results in an altered geometric shape variants from the baseline OC3 spar substructure for all the three cases evaluated. Verification of the nacelle acceleration response in time domain was further evaluated for the three optimal design cases selected and compared with recommended standards which is below 0.3 g. Although, the nacelle acceleration for the optimal variants is more conservative in time domain assessment than the frequency domain assessment, the values are still below the recommended 0.3 g from standards. Also, the masses of selected optimal design for each constraint were compared to the standard OC3 case study. An observation made in this study is that as the static pitch angle of the FOWT system gets larger, the lower the mass of the optimal substructure and inherently the capital expenditure of the substructure. Finally, the selected optimized platforms were analysed with a non-linear, time domain approach to confirm the level of accuracy of the key response parameters obtained with the frequency-based approach. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study presents a novel approach to enhance the longevity and seismic resilience of ‎ Concrete-Filled Steel Tubular (CFST) frame towers commonly used in ‎onshore wind turbines. Fatigue-related failures at welded joints pose significant challenges to the durability of these towers. This research investigates the impact of optimized ring stiffener ‎configurations and concrete infill on reducing stress concentrations and improving ‎fatigue resistance under simulated seismic loading. The study utilizes with samples including CFST-gusset plate joints and non-concrete-filled joints, with different configurations of concrete infill and ring stiffeners. ‎These samples were evaluated under static loading to assess the influence of stiffener width, thickness, and spacing on Stress Concentration Factors (SCFs). Subsequently, cyclic loading tests were conducted to observe crack initiation and progression. The results show that ‎optimized configurations of both concrete fill and ring stiffeners significantly reduce ‎SCFs, improve stress distribution, and delay crack initiation, enhancing the seismic ‎fatigue performance of CFST joints. Moreover, the study integrates Artificial Intelligence ‎‎(AI) techniques, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVM), to predict the fatigue ‎behavior of these joints under different loading conditions. The SVM model was trained on experimental data and demonstrated high predictive accuracy in forecasting the fatigue life of CFST joints, achieving an R² value of 0.95, an RMSE of 0.11, and an MAE of 0.08. These results validate the AI model's ‎ability to optimize design parameters and predict fatigue life, contributing to more ‎efficient and reliable CFST joint design. This integration of AI enhances design ‎optimization by providing precise predictions based on complex variables like stiffener ‎geometry and concrete filling. Overall, the findings suggest that incorporating ‎optimized stiffener configurations, concrete infill, and AI-based design tools can ‎significantly improve the seismic resilience and fatigue life of CFST frame towers joints, ‎providing valuable insights for future engineering practices. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The study aims to contribute to the establishment of the reliability-based design for floating offshore wind turbines by quantifying the uncertainty in Morison's wave force in the extreme conditions for two floating wind turbine platforms, namely, the Spar and the OC4 DeepCwind semi-submersible. Numerical models are developed to estimate the wave forces on cylindrical members with different configurations and then to quantify the uncertainty in the output using the propagation law of uncertainty. Morison's coefficients are extracted from Sarpkaya's data as a function of relative roughness, Keulegan-Carpenter number, Reynolds number and the member inclination angle. The combined uncertainty for each input is investigated based on the gathered data from different sources of uncertainties. The First-Order Second-Moment method is then adopted to quantify the output uncertainty based on the uncertainty in the input variables. Furthermore, the contribution of each random variable to the total uncertainty is analysed. The study reveals that wave height is the most significant contributing random variable to the total uncertainty. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - A barrier to the adoption of floating offshore wind turbines is their high cost relative to conventional fixed-bottom wind turbines. The largest contributor to this cost disparity is generally the floating substructure, due to its large size and complexity. Typically, a primary driver of the geometry and size of a floating substructure is the extreme environmental load case of Region 4, where platform loads are the greatest due to the impact of extreme wind and waves. To address this cost issue, a new concept for a floating offshore wind turbine’s substructure, its moorings, and anchors was optimized for a reference 10-MW turbine under extreme load conditions using OpenFAST. The levelized cost of energy was minimized by fixing the above-water turbine design and minimizing the equivalent substructure mass, which is based on the mass of all substructure components (stem, legs, buoyancy cans, mooring, and anchoring system) and associated costs of their materials, manufacturing, and installation. A stepped optimization scheme was used to allow an understanding of their influence on both the system cost and system dynamic responses for the extreme parked load case. The design variables investigated include the length and tautness ratio of the mooring lines, length and draft of the cans, and lengths of the legs and the stem. The dynamic responses investigated include the platform pitch, platform roll, nacelle horizontal acceleration, and can submergence. Some constraints were imposed on the dynamic responses of interest, and the metacentric height of the floating system was used to ensure static stability. The results offer insight into the parametric influence on turbine motion and on the potential savings that can be achieved through optimization of individual substructure components. A 36% reduction in substructure costs was achieved while slightly improving the hydrodynamic stability in pitch and yielding a somewhat large surge motion and slight roll increase. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The blades of wind turbines constitute key components for converting wind energy into electrical energy, and modifications to blade airfoil geometry can effectively enhance aerodynamic performance of wind turbine. The trailing edge flap enables load control on the blades through adjustments of its motion and geometric parameters, thereby overcoming limitations inherent in conventional pitch control systems. However, current research primarily emphasizes isolated parametric effects on airfoil performance, with limited exploration of interactions between multiple design variables. This study adopts a numerical simulation approach based on the FFA-W3-241 airfoil of the DTU 10 MW. Geometric deformations are achieved by manipulating flap parameters, and the influence on airfoil aerodynamic performance is analyzed using computational fluid dynamics methods. Investigations are conducted into the effects of flap lengths and deflection angles on airfoil aerodynamic characteristics. The results show the existence of an optimal flap length and deflection angle combination. Specifically, when the flap length is 0.1 (Formula presented.) and the deflection angle is 10°, the lift-to-drag ratio demonstrates significant improvement under defined operational conditions. These findings offer practical guidance for optimizing wind turbine airfoil designs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - To meet the increasingly stringent performance indicators of gas turbines, the turbine inlet temperature has increased, and variable geometry turbine technology is widely applied. Therefore, this study developed a quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) method for variable geometry turbine performance considering cooling air mixing based on the elementary blade method and the cooling airflow mixing model. To address the high-dimensional, multi-variable data fitting problem of variable geometry turbines considering the effects of cooling air, this study adopted a BP neural network to further establish a surrogate model for variable geometry turbine performance. A sensitivity analysis of a single-stage turbine was conducted. The variable geometry cooling performance of a single-stage turbine and an E3 five-stage low-pressure air turbine were calculated, and the corresponding surrogate models were established. The relative errors between the calculated mass flow rate and efficiency of the single-stage turbine and the experimental values were no more than 0.70% and 4.44%, respectively; for the five-stage air turbine, the maximum relative errors in mass flow rate and efficiency were no more than 1.67% and 1.385%, respectively. When the throat area of the single-stage turbine nozzle changed by ±30%, the maximum relative errors between the calculated mass flow rate and efficiency and their experimental values were 3.602% and 4.228%, respectively; thus, the determination coefficients of the constructed BP neural network model for the training samples were all greater than 0.999, indicating that the surrogate model has high prediction accuracy and strong generalization ability and can quickly predict variable geometry turbine cooling performance. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

Among the possible alternatives, wind energy has proven to be economically viable and has its growth established in a global scenario. Although a large part of wind generation occurs due to large turbines, small wind turbines meet the demands of distributed and isolated generation. The efficiency of wind turbines, however, is theoretically limited and one possible way to improve the use of wind energy is the use of Diffuser Augmented Wind Turbines (DAWTs). This work aims to study the impact of wind characteristics on the optimal aerodynamic design of a DAWT blade considering non-uniform flow generated using the diffuser. A new expression for the correction of thrust coefficients for high values of axial induction factor is proposed, so that it is suitable for the evaluation of turbines with and without diffusers. Differential Evolution (DE) is used for the evolution of an initial random population of wind turbine rotors to an optimum final population, maximizing energy conversion. The aptitude of each individual to be evolved is evaluated through Blade Element Momentum (BEM) method, using the proposed correction equation. The optimized variables modify the rotor rotation, chord and twist distributions along the turbine radius and pitch angle. The proposed BEM approach, when compared to experimental results for turbines with and without diffusers, showed an average discrepancy of 4.45% for turbines without diffusers and 0.28% for turbines with diffusers, better agreement than other approaches found in the literature. Through the DE optimization it was noted that most of the parameters studied were highly dependent on the wind regime. The use of diffusers in turbines optimized for operation without diffusers allowed for an energy production improvement of up to 28.4% and proved to be dependent on the geometry of the diffuser and the wind regime. A specific optimization process for diffuser operation can lead to energy production improvement up to 32.6% and may affect the benefit of installing the device by up to 22.7%. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Wind turbine inspections are traditionally performed by certified rope teams, a manual process that poses safety risks to personnel and leads to operational downtime, resulting in revenue loss. To address some of these challenges, this study explores the use of deep learning and drones for automated inspections. Three Mask R-CNN models, leveraging different convolutional neural network (CNN) backbones—VGG19, Xception, and ResNet-50—were constructed and trained on a novel dataset of 3000 RGB images (size 300 × 300 pixels) annotated with defects, including cracks, holes, and edge erosion. To improve defect detection performance, a multi-variable fuzzy (MVF) voting system is proposed. This method demonstrated superior accuracy compared to the individual models. The best-performing standalone model, Mask R-CNN with Xception, achieved an mAP of 77.48%, while the MVF system achieved an mAP of 80.10%. These findings highlight the effectiveness of combining fuzzy voting systems with Mask R-CNN models for defect detection on wind turbine blades, offering a safer and more efficient alternative to traditional inspection methods. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper investigates wear in wind turbine pitch bearings resulting from small-amplitude oscillations. The investigation focuses on assessing the impact of key parameters influencing wear damage. A new medium-scale test rig has been designed, enabling cost-efficient and accelerated tests to replicate fretting wear damage under simplified operating conditions of wind turbine pitch bearings. Through experimental result analysis, this study examines the influence of oscillation amplitude, contact force, oscillation frequency, presence of lubrication, and contact geometry on wear damage. A finite element model is also developed to obtain the frictional energy density to compare with experimentally measured wear depth to obtain new insights of the effect of the contact variables on wear damage. It has been found that most of the wear damage takes place at the location where the maximum sliding occurs but not at the location of the maximum contact pressure, while the contact geometry has an important impact on the wear damage. Controlling oscillation amplitude and contact pressure are effective ways to mitigate wear damage due to small-amplitude oscillations in wind turbine pitch bearings. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In various engineering applications, the phase change from steam to water droplet during rapid expansion under supersonic flow conditions is inevitable. The occurrence of condensation waves due to the latent heat released during phase change and aerodynamic shocks reduces equipment performance. Given the complexities of two-phase flow, researchers have always been interested in developing an accurate numerical method that can be used in different flow regimes while reducing computation costs. This research has developed a two-dimensional code using the simple low-dissipation advection upstream splitting method (SLAU) and high-resolution simple low-dissipation advection upstream splitting method (HR-SLAU) in the complex geometry of the steam turbine blades and the convergent-divergent nozzles. The performance of these two schemes was examined using the Eulerian-Lagrangian model under different boundary conditions. The governing equations are investigated using the Eulerian model, which incorporates the SLAU and HR-SLAU schemes, and the equations for determining the wet flow parameters are solved by the Lagrangian approach to predict the liquid mass in the grid cell. Comparative to the experimental data, regarding the simplicity of these two schemes, and in the absence of any tuning flow-dependent variable, the determination of the position and intensity of shocks has been improved considerably, while the droplet radius prediction has been significantly enhanced. Notably, the HR-SLAU scheme, in which the dissipation component of the pressure flux according to a cell-interface orientation angle and flow characteristics is locally controlled by the dissipation coefficient for modeling two-phase flows, leads to fewer numerical errors. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Historically, airfoil design optimization has been done through many different methods, or with the use of improving the aerodynamics in some ways as will be discussed below. Of all the PMS methods that are currently available in the literature, PARSEC marks itself out as the best fitting. One of the most effective methods for changing the shape of an airfoil because of high flexibility and accuracy. The current study aims to determine the utility of the PARSEC parameterization method on two airfoil models. Airfoils NACA 4412, and SG6043 within an angle attack of-10 to 15 degrees, by employing a genetic algorithm. The reliability of the PARSEC method is also assessed by reconstructing the geometries of the airfoil and then comparing the shapes with the original airfoils where these characteristics have a significant influence on the airfoil efficiency. For instance lift coefficient (CL), drag coefficient (CD), and the ratio CL/Cd at different angles of attack. The study also includes the improvement of the aerodynamic design of both airfoils through the use of a genetic algorithm which is coded and run in MATLAB, with the PARSEC parameters used as the base for optimization. It is also important for one to conduct some comparisons between the PARSEC-optimized airfoils and the standard airfoil. The performance of the PARSEC method in making the wing shape the same and similar to the original one is accurate. Aerodynamic characteristics. Significantly, the same was realized in the optimized airfoil and the original airfoil which recorded the maximum pushover speed, drag, and lift characteristics to ±0.3 at an angle of attack of 8 ° and Reynolds number of 10 e5. This paper supports the efficiency of the used PARSEC parameterization. It is found to act as an effective means of support to engineers and researchers who would like to use this method to improve airfoil’s characteristics in aviation, and aeronautical, Such as aerospace applications, and wind turbines. The findings show a positive change in the dependent measures, showing how the variables in the present study fare compared to other studies. By comparing the aerodynamic efficiency of the optimized airfoils, paying attention to the results indicates the use of a genetic algorithm should help to increase several aspects of the wing’s performance. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The probabilistic-based design method is gradually gaining attention in the wind industry because it provides more accurate modeling of uncertainty variables than that of traditional methods. Unfortunately, the numerous uncertainty variables involved in structural design are major obstacles to the successful application of this method. Therefore, this study presents a sensitivity analysis (SA) of a benchmark monopile offshore wind turbine (OWT) to screen the top-ranking variables from the viewpoint of reliability. Primarily, a comprehensive reliability SA framework of OWT is proposed, in which a novel measurement of soil uncertainties is conducted using quantitative analysis from the perspective of soil structure interaction (SSI). Subsequently, a reliability SA is conducted to explore the crucial variables influencing the structural safety from the uncertain clusters. The results indicate that Young's modulus, structural geometry, and SSI have significant effects on the structural reliability of excessive vibration failure. The hydrodynamic and aerodynamic load variables exhibit the most prominent influence on excessive deflection failure. Additionally, the SSI uncertainties exhibit a non-negligible effect in affecting the structural reliability, i.e., the lateral bending stiffness shows more sensitivity to the normal operation cases, whereas the impact of joint stiffness is more remarkable in parked scenarios. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Wind turbine blades experience varying aerodynamic forces in their lifetime. These forces must be accounted for with proper blade design and appropriate material selections. During high winds, vortex-induced vibrations can lead to dangerous vibration amplitudes at the blade's natural frequency, prompting excess material usage to combat fatigue and potential catastrophic failure, thus driving up manufacturing costs. This study investigates particle damping as a passive solution to mitigate such vibrations while optimizing material usage and maintaining structural integrity. Particle damping dissipates energy through inelastic collisions and friction among particles, typically applied in aerospace for small-amplitude, high-frequency vibrations. The research in this paper focuses on applying particle dampers to dampen high-amplitude, low-frequency vibrations, specifically targeting the damping of wind turbine blade flutter during standstill, when the turbine blade is not rotating. After conducting a literature review, research highlights container shape and size along with particle material, shape, and size to be the variables with the highest impact on damping performance. This paper aims to highlight these key variables together in numerous combinations. A two-meter-long vertical aluminum beam was constructed with a natural frequency of its first mode of approximately 2 Hz in order to simulate the wind turbine conditions. Various particle damper configurations—varying in container geometry, particle material, and internal structure—were tested and the most effective damper achieved a 32.9% logarithmic decrement (5.24% critical damping), a 25.7% improvement over the undamped baseline. This design featured 1.5 mm steel spheres in a 9 cm tall, 14 cm diameter container with 19 honeycomb baffles. Key trends highlighted the influence of container dimensions, particle size and material, and internal structure on damping performance. Results confirm particle damping as a viable solution to reduce turbine blade vibrations, with momentum exchange identified as the dominant dissipation mechanism at high amplitudes and low frequencies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Exploring the behavior of conical footings is a significant aspect of geotechnical engineering, particularly in supporting wind turbine towers on mountain slopes. This study employs Finite Element Analysis (FEA) within Plaxis 3D to investigate the behavior of conical footings. The Mohr-Coulomb material is assumed, and the research focuses on two pivotal parameters of soil shear strength: c (cohesion) and φ (friction angle). The study aims to assess the impacts of geometry parameters, consisting of the conical angle (α), the setback ratio (b/B), and the slope angle (β), on the failure mechanisms of conical footing. Furthermore, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) models are implemented with the FEA dataset to propose a predictive formula of the UBC (ultimate bearing capacity) factor, indicating the relationship between these five input parameters and the outcome UBC. A sensitivity analysis was also examined, revealing the contribution of each variable to the UBC of conical footings on slopes. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Wheeled climbing robots equipped with tools can achieve high-coverage machining of large components with free-form surfaces. Trajectory tracking is the foundation for machining. However, there is a lack of a universal yet accurate model for robots while moving on variable curvature surfaces, making it difficult to guarantee tracking performance. Thus, this article proposes a universal contact frame based on differential geometry and establishes a kinematics model that uses surface parameters as state variables for robots moving on variable curvature surfaces. Based on this model, a tracking controller utilizing surface parameters error is then designed, enabling it to be applicable for tracking of climbing robots on free-form surfaces. Experiments with a wheeled climbing robot on a portion of a real wind turbine blade with a radius of more than 1.1 m demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of tracking accuracy of less than 1 mm. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study focuses on improving the blade profile of the Savonius wind rotor by incorporating two distinct optimization strategies. The selected strategies, namely the simplex search method (SSM) and the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), are employed to optimize the blade profile. The resulting profile is then simulated using ANSYS Fluent software to obtain numerical results, with performance evaluated in terms of the power coefficient (Cp). While the SSM relies on a single variable point to define the blade geometry, the NSGA-II considers three variable points. The Cp achieved through NSGA-II exceeds the maximum Cp obtained through the SSM. This finding highlights the effectiveness of the employed methodology in enhancing Cp by utilizing different optimization algorithms. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study aims to investigate the effects of backward-directed winglets applied on the NREL Phase-II reference wind turbine geometry on structural and aerodynamic characteristics and to reveal optimized configurations. The aerodynamic pressure distributions on the blades were imposed as boundary conditions for the FEM analyses since the structural characteristics of the turbine were analyzed by adopting a one-way Fluid Structure Interaction (FSI) approach. The Taguchi analysis with an L27 orthogonal array revealed the descending order of importance of design variables on the coefficient of power ((Formula presented.)): height, cant angle, toe angle, curvature radius, and finally twist angle. For von-Mises stress, the descending order of importance is height, cant angle, toe angle, twist angle, and curvature radius. A multi-objective genetic algorithm using artificial neural network (ANN) models was used to optimize the objectives (Formula presented.) and von-Mises stress. Pareto-optimal solutions with off-design points were obtained, and their performances were compared to the reference NREL Phase-II geometry. As a result, it was observed that there was an increase in (Formula presented.) from 8.07% to 15.56% and the von-Mises stress showed a considerable increase up to 231.13%. The study demonstrates the aerodynamic benefits and structural drawbacks of various winglet designs in horizontal axis wind turbines. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With the increasing penetration of wind power and gradual retirement of conventional generating units (CGUs), wind turbines (WTs) become promising resources to provide steady-state energy reserve (ER) and frequency support for the grid to facilitate supply-demand balance and frequency security. In this regard, a novel frequency constrained dispatch framework with ER and virtual inertia from WTs is proposed. Firstly, this paper establishes the WT model with both ER and virtual inertia, whose energy sources are WT's deloading and rotor kinetic energy, respectively. Secondly, the system frequency response and CGUs' power response are derived while considering WTs exiting inertia response at frequency nadir. Then, this paper develops a stochastic-optimization-based frequency constrained dispatch model, where both WTs' frequency regulation parameters and rotor speeds are decision variables, so that the coupling between WT's mechanical and electrical parts and the coupling between system's transient dynamics and steady-state operation can be fully reflected. Finally, convex hull relaxation, convex hull approximation and deep neural networks are used to transform the original nonlinear model into a mixed-integer second-order cone programming model. Case studies on the 118-bus system verify the effectiveness of the proposed models and methods. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study, computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulation of a vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT) geometry based on the Unsteady Reynolds–Averaged Navier–Stokes equations was investigated. In addition, the relationship between the geometric parameters of the VAWT and the two response variables, that is, moment and lift force, was determined using response surface methodology (RSM). Then, the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) was used to solve the multi-objective optimization problem. The results obtained from the RSM showed that the lift force of the turbine is more sensitive to the change in the blade chord length, and the output moment of the turbine is more sensitive to the change in the rotor radius. Using the NSGA-II multi-objective optimization algorithm and the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method, it was determined that among the optimal values of the independent variable, the most optimal response occurs in blade chord length = 0.18 m, rotor radius = 0.4 m, blade pitch angle = −3.27° and number of blades = 4. In these optimal values of the independent variables, the values of the dependent variables, which included the turbine's moment and the blades’ lift force, were obtained as 9.58 N m and 57.89 N, respectively. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The performance of a wind turbine and its efficiency majorly depends on wind-to-rotor efficiency. The aerodynamic design of the wind turbine blades using high-fidelity tools such as adjoint-computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is accurate but computationally expensive. It becomes impractical when the number of design variables increases for multidisciplinary optimization (MDO). Low-fidelity tools are computationally cheaper but are not accurate, especially in regions of adverse pressure gradient and reverse flows. Surrogate modeling has been used in many aerodynamic problems. We develop and apply a recent architecture of the deep learning module, tandem neural networks (T-NNs) for the inverse design of wind turbine airfoils. The T-NNs trained on CFD data for fully turbulent cases predict not only the performance parameters for the given airfoil geometry but also the airfoil geometry for a given design objective. This framework uses the entire performance polar for inverse design which ensures that the airfoil optimization is not a single-point optimization problem which is essential for practical design problems. The T-NNs are also optimized to include multiple constraints like maximum thickness and trailing edge (TE) thickness which is a novel contribution in the field of inverse design using surrogate models. A statistical analysis is also performed to predict a family of airfoil geometries. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Most wind turbines are installed inside wind farms, where they often operate under wake-affected inflow conditions. New methods are required to evaluate the power performance of a wind turbine in wake, as the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standard procedure is applicable only to wake-free turbines. In this work, we investigate the accuracy of a multivariate power curve acquired through a polynomial regression, whose input variables are wind speed and turbulence measurements retrieved upstream of the turbine's rotor. For this purpose, we use measurements from the SpinnerLidar, a continuous-wave, scanning Doppler lidar measuring the turbine inflow. The SpinnerLidar was mounted in the spinner of a Neg Micon 80 wind turbine located within an onshore wind farm in western Denmark. The input variables are selected among the available lidar measurements with a feature-selection algorithm, resulting in seven input variables, distributed in different locations along the rotor area: six wind speed and one turbulence measurements. The multivariate power curve is tested and compared with IEC-similar power curves under both wake-affected and wake-free conditions. Results show that the multivariate power curve estimates the turbine's power output more accurately than the IEC-similar power curves, with error reductions up to 66.5% and 34.2% under wake-affected and wake-free conditions, respectively. Furthermore, the multivariate power curve estimates have an accuracy of the same order under both wake-affected and wake-free conditions. Finally, we show that the multivariate model accurately predicts the power even when a simple measuring geometry is used, such as circular scanning pattern with a diameter equal to 90% of the rotor. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Butt welds are one of the most common structural details in wind turbine steel towers. In this paper, results from fatigue tests on butt welds in the as-welded and grit-blasted conditions are presented. In addition, finite element analyses were performed using the effective notch stress and the crack propagation approaches. By using macroscopic measurements and three-dimensional scan, the notch effect of the weld seam was considered. These results were compared with results from fatigue tests. On the basis of a successful alignment between simulation and experiment, the possibility to discuss the fatigue resistance influencing variables from the seam geometry is presented. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The attractive specifications of vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT) are its operating with low noise and wind in various directions. To achieve a higher performance of these turbines, modeling of a curved-blade VAWT by the modified double multiple streamtube (DMST) method and optimizing this wind turbine are performed. The power coefficient and the total normal force acting on blades were selected as two objective functions. Minimizing the normal force acting on turbine blades as the second objective function was not observed in the open literature. The amount of normal force is crucial in the structural design of VAWT because it generates both the bending moment on blades and forces on supporting arms of VAWT. Another innovation of this study is to consider the shape coefficient parameter that determines the shape of the rotor geometry as a design variable in optimization procedure. A 3 m height curved-blade VAWT type was optimized by this multi-objective optimization technique. The optimum values of the design variables obtained by the Genetic Algorithm were selecting an elliptical rotor geometry, pitch angle −1.4°, diameter/height 1.3, blade aspect ratio 19.8, tip speed ratio 4.3 and selecting three blades which could provide a power coefficient of 0.49 and a normal force of 158.7 N. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Variable geometry turbines (VGT) hold a crucial role in gas turbines and variable cycle engines (VCE) by allowing adjustments to different operational conditions. In order to realize the adjustable function of the VGT stator blade, there will be partial gap structure at both ends of the stator blade, which will lead to partial leakage flow and serious secondary flow loss at the blade end that cannot be ignored, especially in a large angle adjustment range. At present, there are few researches on turbine cascades considering the real partial gap structure and winglet tip, and the numerical simulation calculation is mainly used, while the in-depth study using wind tunnel test is rarely seen. Therefore, this study attempts to analyze the internal flow characteristics of variable geometry turbine cascade by using five-hole pneumatic probe scanning and surface oil flow visualization, and discusses the mechanism of controlling partial clearance leakage flow and reducing secondary flow loss in the cascade by using winglet tip flow control technology. The winglet offset distance and the change of the relationship between the pivot and the clearance position on the flow field and flow loss is studied experimentally for the first time. The results show that the influence mechanism of winglet tip applied in VGT partial gap is quite different from that of typical blade tip clearance application, and more consideration should be given to the influence of pivot structure. Reasonable parameter selection can achieve a maximum loss reduction of 13.4 % and 20.2 % with and without pivot, respectively, while the unreasonable flow control scheme may lead to the loss or even increase with pivot. The interaction between the new secondary flow structure induced by pivot in the gap and other gap leakage flows is analyzed to explore the new mechanism of using winglet tip to reduce the loss of gap leakage flow. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

However, they face severe sea conditions and high maintenance costs, and a promising method is needed to generate a high-performing, reliable, and robust design. Traditional sequential methods overlook the coupling between sub-systems and may miss the global optimum. The control co-design method, in contrast, focuses on the integrated optimization of the whole system. However, implementing co-simulation and co-optimization for co-design is challenging. In this study, a control co-design framework is developed and validated to couple the platform hydrodynamics with multi-physical wind turbines for integrated simulations and optimization. Based on this framework, the floating platform and tuned mass damper are co-optimized by establishing an efficient Kriging-enhanced Genetic algorithm. A case study is conducted using a 10 MW floating offshore wind turbine for demonstration. The platform shape and tuned mass dampers are parameterized by five and three design variables, respectively. To minimize platform mass, two formulations are proposed, that is, multi- and single-objective, for scenarios with and without consideration of structural loads. These formulas are solved under pre-defined turbulent wind and irregular wave conditions. Compared to the baseline model, the optimal design significantly reduces platform mass, enhancing both power generation and platform motion stability. After involving structural load in optimization, the optimal platform mass, energy production, and platform motion stability are degraded. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the co-design framework in optimizing platform geometry and passive structural control. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The access to the offshore wind resource in the deep sea requires the development of innovative solutions which reduce the cost of energy. Novel technologies propose the hybrid combination of wind and wave energy to improve the synergy between these technologies sharing costs, such as mooring and electrical connexion. This work proposes a novel hybrid wind and wave energy system integrating a floating offshore wind turbine with three-point absorbers wave energy converters (WECs). The WECs are an integral part of the floating structure and contribute significantly to the hydrostatic and dynamic stability of the system. Their geometry is optimised considering a cylindrical, semi-cylindrical and spherical shape for the Pantelleria case study. The cylindrical shape with the largest radius and the lowest height is the optimal solution in terms of reducing structural costs and maximising the performance of the WECs. The in-house hydrostatic stability tool and the time domain model MOST are used to optimise the WECs, with a combined meta-heuristic genetic algorithm with the Kriging surrogate model and a local Nelder–Mead optimization in the final simulations. The power of the WECs is estimated with both linear and variable motor flow hydraulic PTOs to obtain a more realistic electrical power generation. Generally, the hybrid device proved to be more competitive than the floating wind turbine alone, with a LCOE reduction up to 11%. Performance of the hybrid device can be further improved when more energetic sites are considered, as the energy generated by the WECs is higher. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cavity resonances in ducts is a classical problem that has involved researchers from very different fields over time. More recently the aerospace community became engaged again due to resonances found within the flow path of aero-engines, for example in bleed cavities in the low pressure compressor section. These resonances can lead to problems with the structural integrity of upstream components, and thus warrant investigation. This study expands the previous data set of an open box cavity with variable depth (D) and a rectangular opening with length (L), effectively testing L/D = [4, 2, ½] ratios. This parameter was indicated by Rossiter to be a strong predictive parameter in frequency generation. The paper compares the results of the same cavity geometry within two wind tunnels of different dimensions and operational setups. The intention of the study is to isolate the Rossiter modes from any other geometric modes that are due to the wind tunnel’s test section geometry. This isolation allows the modification of the model of Rossiter and the cavity depth model of East in order to improve the predictive capability over a larger range of Mach numbers and for deeper cavities. One wind tunnel has an open loop continuous flow operation where the Mach number is set by changing the outlet static pressure. The second wind tunnel has a blow-down operation where both Mach and Reynolds numbers can be set independently by pulling a downstream vacuum and setting the upstream total pressure. The experiments were performed for an operating range from low subsonic to transonic Mach numbers. The analysis focuses on modifying the constants in both the Rossiter model and the cavity depth model proposed by East along with investigating the phenomenon of mode switching for Rossiter modes. The analyses show a good repeatability of the data set between the two wind tunnels displaying strong resonances at similar operating points. The new proposed constants for the Rossiter model when using an L/D = 2 are γ = 0.15, k = 0.58. For the deeper cavity with L/D = 0.5 the constants proposed are γ = 0.15, k = 0.9. The modification of the cavity depth model by East to better predict the mode above Mach 0.3 is proposed by adjusting the constant B = 2.5 and leaving A = 0.65. An independence from Reynolds number of the acoustic frequency generation is demonstrated within the operating range. A mode-switching behavior is identified with the shallowest and deepest cavity showing multiple mode transitions within the operating range and a near constant Rossiter mode 1 for L/D=2. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Hydro turbine operation far off from its best efficiency point introduces vortices and swirl that detaches flow from the blade surface. This break-off of flow accounts to loss in hydrodynamic lift accompanied by pressure fluctuations and vibration that leads to poor performance and mechanical failure of the turbine blades. Vortex generators (VGs) are efficient passive devices deployed to enhance aerodynamic lift of wind turbine blades and aircraft wings and can improve hydrodynamic lift on turbine runner blades as well. This study aims to investigate on the possibility of installation of VGs on the runner blade at leading edge, midspan and trailing edge of the runner blade. The study is carried out on a model Francis turbine developed at Waterpower Laboratory, NTNU. The numerical study is mainly focused on improving performance of the turbine at low speed as well as at the best efficiency speed. The operating head selected for the study is 11.94 m and the speed of the turbine is varied from 233 rpm to 433 rpm at an increment of 25 rpm. The turbine is simulated at different positions of guide vanes and hydraulic performance is calculated and the results of the analysis are compared with reference case without VGs. The results at deep-part load show major improvement in runner efficiency with increment in values up to 4%. The core purpose of the research is to develop effective techniques to operate traditional turbine runner at variable speed with cost-efficient minimal modifications in the geometry of the runner blades. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Given the continuous increases in wind turbine (WT) rated power and size, the nacelle weight and logistic handling costs increases significantly. To support heavier nacelles, stronger towers are needed which again increases material costs, so a need for nacelle power density increase arises. One solution to this problem is to increase the power density of the cast or forged WT main shaft. The power density in cast main shafts is limited by the low tensile strength of cast iron. High tensile strength steels, which theoretically increase power density, are used in state-of-the-art forged main shafts. However, their inner shaft diameter is kept small to reduce drilling costs. Since the loads of WT main shafts are dominated by the bending moments of the rotors, a high section modulus corresponds to a high power density. Material near the centre of the shaft therefore decreases the shaft power density. Hollow forging combines high tensile strength steel with a variable inner shaft diameter, enabling shaft designs with increased power density. Additionally, the use of air-hardening ductile (AHD) steel eliminates the need for costly heat treatment if the wall thickness is thin enough. The paper presents a holistic system model for the predesign of main bearing units (MBU) considering various materials and manufacturing methods. The model enables a feasibility assessment of hollow forged main shafts by comparing the resulting MBU weights across a wide range of WT power ratings. The MBU is selected instead of solely analysing the main shaft to account for the bearing and bearing housing weights, which depend on the main shaft geometry. The results show increased MBU power density of up to 23% for hollow forged shafts compared to forged shafts of the same material. Furthermore, when the shaft is hollow forged from AHD steel, the increase is even greater, up to 52%. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents the applicability of a new hybrid tool chain for wind turbine rotor turbulent boundary-layer trailing-edge noise (TBL-TEN) to complex rotor geometries. The research introduces a rapid, high-fidelity 2D CFD/CAA method, which enables the assessment of innovative low-noise profile designs concerning TBL-TEN, coupled with a mid-fidelity extrapolation technique for the 3D analysis, aiming to minimize computational time essential for design processes. This procedure is applied here to compare the changes in performance, load distribution and noise reduction if a winglet is added to a large-scale wind turbine, using the example of the IEA Wind TCP Task 47 15-MW-reference turbine [12]. In the first step, a 3D CFD calculation of the entire turbine is performed in order to derive the local flow parameters and thus the input variables for the 2D CAA. These results for the 2D TEN are then extrapolated for the entire turbine using the fast summation and extrapolation method TAP (Turbine acoustic prediction) [1]. As only data for the TEN is included here, only this noise source for the winglet can be analyzed. For a more complete comparison, a 3D scale-resolving simulation was set up for a static wind tunnel situation in order to be able to qualitatively classify the tip/vortex interaction noise that was not recorded by the procedure mentioned above. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The article presents the results of the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) research on a vertical axis wind turbine with a variable swept area. The tested turbine has four sets of blades, each of which consists of two moving parts. By changing the angle between these parts, it is possible to change the swept area of the turbine wheel to adjust the characteristics of the turbine to the current wind speed. In the case of strong wind, it is possible to fold blades to protect the rotor against damage. The 3D-CFD model was tested using the ANSYS Fluent software. The four rotors differing in the blade angle were analyzed. The tests were carried out for different wind speeds. The results are presented as pressure and velocity distributions as well as streamlines around the rotor. In addition, the waveforms of the torque acting on a single blade and on the entire rotor are shown. The average rotor torque was also calculated. These findings enabled us to create the characteristics of the power factor for different rotational speeds of the rotor. The results show that the adjustment of the swept area makes the z-turbine have a flexible operating range. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In order to achieve the design goals of lightweight and high annual cycle efficiency of permanent magnet synchronous wind turbine, an optimization design method of electromechanical cooperative parameters of permanent magnet synchronous generator-gear transmission system is proposed. Firstly, the calculation model of wind turbine is established and the annual wind speed measured by wind farm is taken as the operating condition of wind turbine. Then, the loss model of the gear transmission system is established, and the saturation flux model, torque model and loss model of the permanent magnet synchronous generator are established based on the finite element method. On this basis, in order to maximize the efficiency potential of wind turbine under each parameter, the nonlinear efficiency optimal current distribution strategy is used to optimize the control current of the generator. Finally, under the conditions of generator electromagnetic constraints, gear geometry and strength constraints, and continuous transmission constraints, the parameters of the generator and gear are taken as the optimization variables, and the total mass of the permanent magnet synchronous generator-gear transmission system and the total loss under the annual cycle wind speed condition are taken as the objective functions. NSGA-Ⅱ algorithm is used to optimize the objective function. The optimization process includes internal nested optimization, and the whole process is run automatically through the script, which minimizes the loss and weight of the system and reduces the time cost. Based on the above method, the 8 MW permanent magnet synchronous generator-gear transmission system is optimized. After optimization, the total mass of the system is reduced by 40.2%, and the annual cycle loss of the system is reduced by 461 562.53 kW·h, indicating that the method effectively reduced the mass of the system and improved the annual cycle efficiency. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - GFRP-concrete-steel composite columns (GCS) are formed by combining different components with excellent mechanical properties. The GCS exhibits good corrosion resistance and can serve as a pile foundation platform for offshore wind turbines. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is utilized to swiftly predict the loading capacity of GCS columns with various geometrical parameters. The prediction error is primarily controlled within 10%. The thickness of GFRP tubes (t<inf>G</inf>), the inner diameter of GFRP tubes (D<inf>G,i</inf>), the thickness of steel tubes (t<inf>s</inf>), the outer diameter of steel tubes (D<inf>S,o</inf>), the strength of GFRP tubes (f<inf>G</inf>), the strength of concrete (f<inf>C</inf>), and the strength of steel tubes (f<inf>S</inf>) were used as independent variables to determine the key factors affecting the loading capacity of GCS columns. The impact of the number of input variables on the final prediction accuracy is analyzed. The proportional influence of different parameters on the loading capacity of GCS column is investigated using the Garson algorithm, among which, the thickness of the GFRP tube (t<inf>G</inf>) accounts for the largest proportion, approximately 24.57%. The suitability of the artificial neural network for predicting the loading capacity of GCS columns with various geometries is revealed. The results indicate that the ANN can be utilized for high-precision compressive strength prediction, and the thickness of the GFRP tube (t<inf>G</inf>) is the most influential factor on the loading capacity of GCS columns. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Remarkable characteristics like simple structure, high starting torque, simple maintenance, good efficiency at all speeds and cost-effectiveness have made switched reluctance machines (SRMs) suitable candidates for electric cars, electric bicycles and variable speed applications (VSAs) such as wind turbines. In this paper, a three-phase Outer-Rotor SRM (ORSRM) with 6 stator poles and 10 rotor poles (6/10) for VSA has been investigated. Unlike conventional SRM structures such as 6/4 and 12/8, an SRM model with higher number of rotor poles can reduce torque ripple much more effective than conventional SRMs. First, the SRM design is done accurately, then, by changing some parameters, the sensitivity analysis is performed on torque ripple and average torque. Finally, the optimisation process on the geometry and structural dimensions of the SRM like rotor pole arc, stator pole arc, rotor yoke thickness, rotor pole height, rotor diameter and the number of turns per phase are executed to minimise the torque ripple and maximise the average torque via genetic algorithm (GA). The initial design, optimisation and performance of the proposed model are validated via a 2-D finite element method (FEM) technique by ANSYS-Maxwell. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Simulation of vertical-axis wind turbines (VAWT) is challenging due to the highspeed rotation of the blades, complex high-Reynolds number turbulent flow with massive separation involved. Addressing such problems requires an efficient numerical approach to robustly handle the dynamics of the geometry while accurately predicting the flow dynamics. DNS simulations have been conducted for the first time to the best of the authors knowledge on a VAWT. This was achieved by using a framework incorporating a moving reference frame formulation (MRF) of Navier-Stokes (NS) equations with the spectral/ hp method within the Nektar++ framework. DNS was performed upon a quasi-3D (homogeneous extrusion of the 2D model in the 3rd dimension), three-bladed, straight-bladed Darrieus VAWT. The environmental conditions were akin to the low pressure, low Reynolds number atmosphere found on Mars allowing for this work to be extended to assessing VAWTs potential as an energy source on extra-terrestrial missions, connecting high-order methods to industrial applications. The effect of the order of the polynomial expansion of the variables as well as the resolution within the extrusion upon the present vortex dynamics and aerodynamic forces has been assessed © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In this work, metamodeling was performed to conduct efficiency-based design optimization (EBDO) of an H-rotor VAWT coupled with fixed guiding-walls surrounding its rotor. A design of experiments (DoE) created sampling points from the desired design space. Kriging generated surrogate models using input and output pairs calculated by CFD analyses. The Nelder–Mead Downhill Simplex optimization technique was used to determine the optimal design which satisfied the stated constraints. An estimated level of uncertainty was assigned to each random design variable for the efficiency analyses. Designing of guiding walls were considered, with different geometrical parameters. The results of the surrogate model were compared with those of the CFD, and an optimal solution was selected. The Open Darrieus VAWT and Optimal Darrieus​ VAWT with guiding-walls comparison revealed a considerable improvement of up to 177% at λ=3. It was evident that the enhancement in power coefficient due to augmentation of airflow velocity when VAWT is equipped with guiding walls. As a result, the placement and formation of the guiding walls has a significant role in the amount of power produced. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The design of a two-dimensional variable geometry inlet which applied to a tandem type turbine-based combined cycle (TBCC) propulsion system was investigated in the present paper through three-dimensional simulations and wind tunnel tests. The operation Mach number range was between 0 and 3. A multi-ramp geometry scheme was adopted to achieve acceptable performance at different inflow Mach number. The first ramp angle was fixed whilst the angles of the second and the third ramps were variable at different inflow Mach numbers. The Mach numbers at throat region were maintained between 1.3 and 1.5 at different inflow Mach numbers according to this variable geometry scheme. A fixed geometry rectangular-to-circular shape diffuser was adopted to improve aerodynamic performance of the inlet. Three-dimensional numerical simulations were carried out between Ma1.5 and Ma3.0. The results indicated that good aerodynamic performance can be achieved at different inflow speed. At the design point, total pressure recovery of the inlet was 0.66 at critical condition. Wind tunnel validation experiment tests were conducted at Ma2.0, showing the movement of terminal shock wave from downstream to upstream as the back pressure increased. The inlet operated at supercritical, critical and subsonic conditions at different back pressure. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper, the dynamic regulating process of a variable-geometry power turbine is investigated through wind-tunnel experiments. Particle image velocimetry is used to obtain the dynamic evolution of the flowfield in the cascade passage, including two adjustment processes of increasing and decreasing the throat area. During the test, snapshots of the clockwise/counterclockwise rotation of a blade in the range of 10 to −2.7 deg are processed with a piecewise time-averaged method. The results indicate that the macroscopic change in the flowfield structure mainly appears in the wake region and the high-velocity region. In this process, the velocity and flow angle change monotonously with the blade rotation. The change rate of velocity is determined by both the blade position and the dimensionless outlet location l∕l<inf>0</inf>. The overall change rate of velocity when the blade approaches the design position is higher than that at other positions, and the airflow near the suction surface is more sensitive to the adjustment of the cascade geometry compared with that near the pressure surface. As for the flow angle, the specific value is mainly determined by the blade position, and the variation law is related to the blade rotation speed. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In this article, the seismic response of four different Offshore Wind Turbines (OWTs) from 5 to 15 MW, founded on monopiles embedded in homogeneous and non-homogeneous soil profiles with equivalent shear-wave velocities from 100 to 300 m/s is analysed. Two types of variable soil profiles with a semi-parabolic variation of the shear-wave velocity as depth increases are considered. The system seismic response under ten different accelerograms is computed through a finite element substructuring model in frequency domain. The foundation behaviour is obtained by a continuum model including kinematic and inertial interaction. Several models, in addition to that of rigid base condition, are considered to determine the influence of soil-structure interaction (SSI), as well as the contribution of each kinematic interaction (KI) factor. The seismic response of the OWTs is obtained in terms of maximum shear forces and bending moments at mudline level, as well as the acceleration amplification factor at hub level. It is found that the maximum response is produced when SSI is considered, including both the inertial and kinematic interaction. The differences arising due to the soil profile definition are shown to be mainly related to the rotational KI factor, which significantly affects the second vibration mode of the system. The largest responses are obtained for the homogeneous equivalent profile. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Inspired by seashells available in nature, a horizontal-axis wind turbine was developed for urban usage, based on Archimedean conical-spiral. It uses both lift and drag to harvest the kinetic energy from the wind by redirecting the flow 90∘ relative to its original direction. The spiral wind turbine in its basic design has been studied in previous research but the optimal geometrical parameters that control the conical-spiral shape have not been identified yet. This paper aims to identify an optimal seashell-shaped rotor configuration, delivering the highest output power under thrust constraints through a systematic multi-objective optimization process. Three relevant geometrical parameters (1) the spiral maximum rotation angle θ<inf>max</inf>, (2) the spiral initial stretch, z<inf>0</inf>, (3) the shell opening angle, γ, are varied in order to maximize the power coefficient (C<inf>P</inf>) and minimize the thrust coefficient (C<inf>T</inf>) of the wind turbine. The spiral maximum radius (r<inf>max</inf>) has been kept constant to provide the same input power for all geometries. The optimization was accomplished using the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) coupled with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) for the evaluation of the fitness of the individuals. The CFD models employed were validated against results available in the literature for a 1/10 scaled model of the prototype of 0.5 kW-class horizontal-axis spiral wind turbine. A total of 270 simulations over 9 generations were executed to obtain a Pareto front for the 3-bladed wind turbine. Among all the design variables considered, the shell opening angle (γ) and the spiral initial stretch (z<inf>0</inf>) were notably the most sensitive parameters to the power output and the axial thrust, respectively. The results revealed that it is favorable to decrease the spiral maximum rotation angle and to increase both spiral initial stretch and shell opening angle for this kind of turbines to achieve a good trade-off in between both objectives. In comparison with the reference rotor, the optimized turbine increased the power coefficient by 14% with a C<inf>P</inf>= 0.305 and reduced the thrust coefficient by 9.6% with a C<inf>T</inf>= 0.719 at the design operating condition (λ= 2.2). © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The use of generative design as an alternative to typical structural optimization techniques opens the door to new methods of manufacturing. In this study, generative design techniques were used as an automated iterative process with an extensive set of control variables and initial models to explore and optimise the stiffness and weight of different configurations for a 3 MW offshore wind turbine electrical generator structure. With this new approach of adding generative design techniques to a structural optimization process, a 4% reduction in structural mass was achieved. The modification in the structural geometry also help to enlarge the machine's operational range with the consequent growth in energy gathering. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs) are feasible to be improved due to lower efficiency compared to the horizontal axis type and suffer from fatigue issues as a result of cyclic aerodynamic loading. The performance of VAWTs can definitely be enhanced by utilizing a variable pitch angle mechanism and specific-efficient airfoils, especially at low tip speed ratios (TSRs). With this background, the scope of the present investigation is 2-fold. In the first part, Taguchi and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods will be used to perform a thorough sensitivity analysis. Then, in the second part, a multi-objective optimization problem will be defined based on the results of part-1 to address the mentioned drawbacks. This part proposes a novel procedure to accomplish sensitivity analysis. A MATLAB code was used to automatically manage suitable simulations for implementing the proposed innovative statistical-aerodynamic analysis. Five objective functions are offered, including power indices, structural and fatigue demands. Design variables consist of 12 parameters related to the pitch angle profile and the blade section geometry. The sensitivity analysis was implemented in three main stages: executing various simulations under distinct conditions based on orthogonal tables, assessing the hypothesis of using different pitch angle profiles for each blade instead of the same pitch profile for all blades, and describing sensitivities using signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) analysis. The same pitch profile idea was proved appropriate based on the results. The third stage result would reflect the order of importance of design variables regarding each objective in detail. Finally, the best-simulated cases are reported and different aerodynamic aspects will be explored. By using the proposed modifications, both upwind and downwind power performance could be enhanced. However, the fatigue problem could be reduced by lowering the maximum local moment coefficient. The integrated systematic approach used in this paper could be considered a unified framework for sensitivity analysis of variable pitch wind turbines. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study, a multi-objective optimization is performed to improve the performance of a Darrieus vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT) at low tip speed ratios considering the aerodynamic and structural objectives. In this regard, firstly, a multi-objective optimization platform is developed. Using the results of part-1 of the current research, design of experiment (DOE) analysis, more effective design variables and their limited range of variation were extracted. These quantities were selected from pitch profile and blade section geometry variables, which will form a minimal optimization problem including the essential physics with reduced computational cost. The optimization is executed using a homemade NSGA-II code, validated by a benchmark model. It is embedded within the main MATLAB code, which relates and controls the flow field solution and optimization loop. Average moment coefficient in the downwind phase, the maximum moment coefficient in the upwind phase and the bending stiffness were selected as objective functions. These parameters would reflect power, structural fatigue and strength, respectively. The Pareto front charts are provided, which depict the relationship between objectives. It will then be followed by trend analysis and provide trade-off capability. Different aerodynamic aspects of the optimized VAWT are also compared with the reference VAWT, demonstrating the effects of optimum pitch profile and blade section. The trend analysis shows a compromise between structural and aerodynamic objectives, while the two indices of maximum moment and stiffness are not opposing. Moreover, a practical method for effective angle of attack identification is employed. Based on this estimation, one may deduce that the angle of attack in the upwind phase is more influenced by pitch variation than in the downwind. Interestingly, thrust coefficient and thrust angle variation range reduction would be achieved as a result of the proposed optimization, which is beneficial for the whole system's stability. According to the results, the developed framework is capable of performing other multi-disciplinary optimization challenges. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Aeroacoustic noise is a major concern in wind turbine design that can be minimized by optimizing the airfoils that shape the rotating blades. To this end, we present a framework for airfoil shape optimization to reduce the trailing edge noise for the design of wind turbine blades. Far-field noise is evaluated using Amiet's theory coupled with the TNO-Blake model to calculate the wall pressure spectrum and fast turn-around XFOIL simulations to evaluate the boundary layer parameters. The computational framework is first validated using a NACA0012 airfoil at 0° angle of attack. Particle swarm optimization is used to find the optimized airfoil configuration. The multi-objective optimization minimizes the A-weighted overall sound pressure level at various angles of attack, while ensuring enough lift and minimum drag. Furthermore, traditional shape optimization techniques show difficulties to converge to the optimum, when too many shape parameters are included in the optimization. For this reason, we compare classic parameterization methods to define the airfoil geometry (i.e., CST) to a machine learning method (i.e., a variational autoencoder). We observe that variational autoencoders can represent a wide variety of geometries, with only four encoded variables, leading to efficient optimizations, which result in improved optimal shapes. When compared to the baseline geometry, a NACA0012, the autoencoder-based optimized airfoil reduces by 3% (1.75 dBA) the overall sound pressure level (with decreased noise across the entire frequency range), while maintaining favorable aerodynamic properties in terms of lift and drag. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Wind energy has emerged as an attractive alternative to the current fossil fuel-based energy mix. In this context, small-scale H-Darrieus vertical-axis wind turbines (VAWTs) combine interesting characteristics for harvesting wind energy in urban-like conditions. Still, H-Darrieus turbines are reported to experience relatively low aerodynamic efficiency. Even though several devices have been proposed to increase the aerodynamic performance of H-Darrieus turbines, the literature seems to overlook the potential of specifically designed airfoil shapes. In part, this is a by-product of different shortcomings related to the most common airfoil parameterization methods, such as restricted shape variability, high dimensionality, discontinuous spaces, and/or non-orthogonal parameters. Seeking to overcome these drawbacks altogether, we investigate here the benefits of the Bézier-GAN as an airfoil parameterization method for H-Darrieus turbines. For that, we use computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations along with sensitivity analysis, metamodeling, and optimization strategies. The results show that the Bézier-GAN integrates nicely with the proposed framework, substantially reducing the total computational cost of the experiment. By expanding the bounds of the latent design space, we can easily explore novel airfoil designs. The sensitivity analysis clearly indicates a lack of two-way interactions between the latent variables, which further simplifies both the metamodeling and the optimization processes. The optimal geometry increased the turbine performance by 20.5% relative to a NACA 0015 and by 9.1% relative to a NACA 0021—two common airfoil shapes used in H-Darrieus turbines. Interestingly, the optimal geometry was found outside the original bounds of the design space, further confirming that the search for novel airfoil designs may open the way for better aerodynamic performance of small-scale H-Darrieus turbines. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The objective of the presented work was to develop a new forging process for a pinion shaft as a component of a wind turbine. A study of near-net-shape forming using Deform 3D software was performed to reduce operational cost, time, and material scrap; enhance specific properties; increase productivity. Near-net forged products have good dimensional accuracy and continuous metal flow lines, which are characteristic of improved mechanical properties. To avoid the traditional trial-and-error experimental method, the process and tool design were accomplished with a careful and detailed numerical simulation approach. In the present work, the Finite Element Method was used to develop a process model for the existing hot forging process of the 18CrNiMo7-6 steel pinion shaft used in a wind turbine. The developed numerical process model was validated via experiment including a comparison of the metal flow lines from the FEM model with the metallography results of the forged part. Two new die designs were proposed, and the simulation results were compared to the actual process to achieve improved geometry. The results for the new geometries showed improvements in terms of the die cavity filling for the new proposed dies and better results in grain flow orientation. Compared to the initial non-optimized die, the new designs improved the mechanical properties and savings associated with the lower volume of required raw material and fewer finishing operations. Considering the applied stresses and wear in the new near-net shape, the die geometry shall be updated to accommodate more severe solicitations. Naturally, all the improvements carried out are dependent on other factors such as the conditions of the equipment, operator skills, lubrication, and other variables. A surface heat treatment is also suggested for stress relief as a reliability improvement. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Aspects concerning resonance and global stability of a wind turbine blade must be carefully considered in its optimal design. In this paper, a composite wind turbine blade with an external geometry based on the NREL 5 MW model was subjected to multi-objective structural optimization considering these aspects. Four multi-objective structural optimization problems are formulated considering the blade mass, the maximum blade tip displacement, the natural frequencies of vibration, and the critical load factor as objective functions. The design variables are the number of plies, material, and fiber orientation. The design constraints are the materials’ margin of safety, the blade’s allowable tip displacement, and the minimum load factor. The blade model is submitted to the loads determined by the actuator lines theory and discretized in a finite element parameterized model using the Femap software according to geometric design variables. Among many multi-objective evolutionary algorithms available in the literature concerning evolutionary computation, the NSGA-II is the adopted evolutionary algorithm to solve the multi-objective optimization problems. Pareto fronts are obtained and performance indicators are used to evaluate the distribution of the non-dominated solutions. Multi-criteria decision-making is used to extract the solutions from the Pareto fronts according to the decision-maker’s preferences. The values of the objective functions, design variables, and constraints are presented for each extracted solution. The proposed study is expected to contribute to the multi-objective optimization and the structural design of wind turbine blades. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The influence of scarf repair variables on the mechanical properties of glass fiber reinforced polymer sandwich structures is examined for the application of wind turbine blade shell repairs. Reference shell specimens are tested under fully-reversed cyclic loading to understand the fatigue behavior of the sub-component structure within a range of in-service loads, to which shell specimens with a scarf joint repair are compared. A fatigue-superior repair material is shown to improve the fatigue behavior of the repaired structures compared to the reference specimens. In separating layup and geometry, damage development is examined on the sub-component scale for a structural understanding of a scarf repair using in-situ digital image correlation-based strain field measurements as well as passive thermography. Within scarf repair variables, the geometry is shown to play a larger role than layup in the fatigue performance of the repaired structure. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - For the first time, the geometry of the Invelox wind delivery system is optimized in this paper using a multi-objective surrogate-based optimization method. The feasibility of electricity production by installing a Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine (HAWT) inside the throat of the optimal Invelox is also investigated using 3D CFD simulations. The Advanced Latin Hypercube Sampling (ALHS) method is used to construct the sample space after selecting geometrical design variables. Then, the objective functions at the training points are calculated by the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models. Kriging (KRG) surrogate models have been fitted to the outputs of sample space and coupled with the Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) algorithm to obtain the optimal Invelox geometry. According to the results, the net mass flow rate of air entering the Invelox and wind power at the Venturi's throat have increased by 64.7% and 279.9%, respectively. The third optimization target has also been satisfied by eliminating backflow at the diffuser outlet. Comparing the primary and optimal Invelox reveals that the wind speed ratio has risen from 1.6 to 2.4. Lastly, a HAWT has been designed for the optimal Invelox, and its performance in both ducted and bare modes has been evaluated. It has been found that installing a turbine inside the throat, increases the pressure drop across the ducting system, adversely affecting the overall performance of the Invelox and wind turbine. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents the design and an analysis of a surface PM vernier generator (SPMVG) for MW-scale direct-drive (DD) wind turbine application. An SPMVG has the advantage of higher torque density; however, especially at higher power ratings with increased electrical loadings, the power factor worsens and there are some serious concerns including magnetic saturation of cores and PM demagnetization. These issues are directly related to machine design parameters such as PM dimensions, applied electrical loading, slot geometry and the choice of slot–pole combination. It is determined that depending on the PM thickness and a few other design variables, each slot–pole combination has an optimal value of specific electrical loading. The use of the optimal value of specific electrical loading ensures that the machine is not saturated, the performance is optimum and the power factor is not unnecessarily degraded. Moreover, under certain design constraints, design criteria are developed that ensure the proper choice of various entailed design variables. By using the developed design criteria, the trends of various electromagnetic performances with variation in the slot–pole combination are discussed. The obtained trends clearly show that each slot–pole combination offers a certain torque density and power factor; thus, it serves as a guide for the selection of the slot–pole combination considering the required torque density and/or certain power factor limit. Finally, by using the developed design approach, an SPMVG for rated power of 15 MW is designed; the design objectives are to maximize torque per volume with a power factor limit of 0.4. Moreover, the various aspects of the performances of the designed SPMVG are comprehensively compared against a conventional PM DD 15 MW generator. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The use of renewable energy sources to supply power to energy-isolated areas is an urgent topic. The simplicity of the design and high reliability of inductor generators create good prospects for their use in wind power plants as an alternative to synchronous and asynchronous electric machines that are currently in use. An obstacle to such an application is the specifics of the design, construction, and execution of modular machines with magnetic switching, concentrated windings, and a distributed magnetic system integrated into the wind turbine design. The purpose of the study is to consider cause-effect relationships and establish relationships between magnetic flux, EMF, the geometry of electric and magnetic circuits, the structural arrangement of electric windings, and circuit solutions of an automatic electromagnetic excitation system for the design of a new type of generators. The current issues of the effective use of an exciting magnetic flux for voltage regulation in power supply systems powered by power plants, the main generators of which contain a distributed magnetic system with concentrated electric windings, are considered. The optimal structural compositions and geometry of the ratios of electric and magnetic circuits are determined from the machine's basic calculation equation, which is obtained under the condition of maximum magnetic flux. The reasons for the induction of variable EMF in the DC excitation windings, which prevent the effective magnetization of the machine, have been established. The location of the electric windings is proposed, which makes it possible to weaken or completely compensate for the pulsations of the magnetic flux coupled with the exciting circuits. It is established that in order to eliminate parasitic EMF in the exciting windings, it is necessary to use two-circuit circuits for alternating switching of the magnetic flux in the circuits, with sequential activation of the sections of the windings of the exciting circuits. To completely eliminate these EMFs, performing two-circuit magnetic flux switching circuits with a common exciting winding is advisable. The methods and features of the circuit implementation of the conditions of electromagnetic excitation and maintenance of voltage constancy at the output of generators of a new type are considered. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The fatigue strength verification of constructional details in towers of wind turbines is generally carried out using nominal stresses acc. to the Eurocode 3, part 1-9. Butt-welded joints are one of the most common constructional details in these structures. In this paper, results from fatigue tests on transversely loaded butt welds and FEA using the effective notch stress and the crack propagation approaches are presented. By using macroscopic measurements and a 3D scan, the notch effect of the weld seam geometry was considered in the FEA. These results were compared with results from fatigue tests. Based on the successful alignment between simulation and experiment, the possibility to discuss the fatigue resistance influencing variables from the seam geometry is presented. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In order to investigate the part clearance leakage flow field through a variable area nozzle turbine (VANT), an experimental setup of the annular sector cascade (ASC) with eight numbers of passages is being developed. The second stage low-pressure turbine stator from Energy Efficient Engine proposed by Pratt and Whitney was selected and modified for the VANT concept. The intermediate turbine duct (ITD) - connecting the highpressure turbine with the low-pressure turbine was inevitable to be incorporated between the wind tunnel and ASC test section for the following reasons: a) ITD will ensure the geometric continuity on the hub and casing end-walls, and b) it will provide realistic entry flow field with radial pressure gradient. The diverging shape of the ITD with continuously increasing mean radius imposes a major challenge to achieving the required inlet flow angle with periodicity at the entry of the ASC. Hence, the present study focuses on the challenging work of modifying the existing annular ITD to achieve the required inlet flow for ASC. The various geometries of the ITD, including different flow control methods, were numerically analyzed using commercial software ANSYS CFX®. The flow field of the numerical simulations at multiple locations was analyzed using flow angle and its distribution, velocity streamlines, static pressure recovery coefficient, and total pressure loss coefficient. It was found that the IGVs direct the flow through the ITD, and approximately the required flow condition with periodicity was achieved at the entry of the test vane cascade. As an active flow control method, an opening slot was modelled on the casing end-wall at the upstream region of the test vane cascade. However, the numerical analysis shows an adverse effect on the flow angle distribution at the entry of the cascade. The change in axial spacing between IGVs and the test vane cascade shows a negligible effect on the cascade entry flow field. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In conventional wind power plants, the wind turbine drives an electrical generator equipped with an AC/DC converter for battery charging purposes and with an inverter inverter to supply power to the grid/AC load. This approach exhibits some drawbacks like the energy losses associated to the power electronics and the cost and the waste management of the battery storage systems. To overcome such drawbacks, this work proposes a new plant scheme, where the battery system has been removed (or strongly reduced) and the storage task is accomplished by a pumping system equipped with a reversible hydraulic machinery which can operate both as centrifugal pump and a hydraulic turbine (called Pump as Turbine). In this scenario, when the wind velocity is quite high, the reversible hydraulic machinery, working as centrifugal pump, will store energy in the form of potential energy pumping fluid to an elevated water reservoir. On the contrary, in low wind conditions, the Pump as Turbine will operate as a hydraulic turbine, helping the wind turbine to overcome the external mechanical load. This solution results in a number of advantages: lower plant costs, longer Pump as Turbine life with lesser maintenance and reduced waste costs. The present work focuses on a multi-objective performance analysis of the proposed wind system power scheme. Specifically, this multi-objective sensitivity analysis will be addressed to the net potential energy stored by the reversible hydraulic machinery, the extracted wind energy and the torque supplied by the Pump as Turbine in hydraulic turbine mode. Such an analysis will considered as design variables the Pump as Turbine (centrifugal pump mode) specific speed (pump geometry), the gear box transmission ratio between the centrifugal pump and the wind turbine and the pump head. The aim of this analysis is to evaluate the design variables range which could lead to determine the set of the multi-objective wind systems optimal design. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The development of high-performance wind turbine blade airfoil families is an important research topic in wind power generation technology. Using the NACA63 series airfoil as the initial airfoil, the XFOIL software based on the panel method is used to calculate the airfoil's lift-drag coefficient. Secondly, an improved Hicks-Henne shape function is employed to define the airfoil's geometry. Finally, a single objective optimization model is established based on three optimization algorithms (genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization algorithm, and particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm), which takes the control coefficient of shape function as a variable, the maximum of lift coefficient and lift-drag ratio as the goal, and satisfies the geometric and aerodynamic constraints. Different angles of attack, Reynolds numbers and weight coefficients are considered, there are seven groups high-performance airfoil families obtained (ZDGN-ASG, ZDGN-ASP, ZDGN-ASPG, ZDGN-ASR1, ZDGN-ASR5, ZDGN-ASQ3, ZDGN-ASQ8). The lift coefficients and lift-to-drag ratios are higher than those of the initial airfoil under the same operating conditions, and have been applied to the actual 1.2MW wind turbine blades. The results show that the output power and wind energy utilization coefficient of the new blades are significantly improved, further proving that the new airfoil family has superior aerodynamic performance. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In this research, an optimisation study is carried out to improve the structural performance of a highly efficient wind turbine blade. The rotor blade is a 13-m long composite blade designed for retrofitting a 225-kW wind turbine. Its external geometry, constructed with modified NACA 63 series airfoils, was designed to enhance wind turbine power production efficiency. This research aims to optimise the internal structure of the wind turbine blade, with the objective to increase the blade stiffness. A set of design variables is used to define the blade internal structure. The optimisation methodology used in the study is based on the screen method. This is achieved by sampling different sets of variables and performing the structural analysis to adopt a variable set which has a relatively good performance. For each variable set, the blade structure performance is evaluated by finite element analysis. By applying the screen method, the blade stiffness has an improvement of 33 % while the blade self-weight has a reduction of 4%. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Abstract: Approaches to the design of a magnetic system with electromagnetic continuously variable transmission for a wind turbine making it possible to obtain a high internal gear ratio or a high specific torque are considered. A finite element method is used to perform the numerical static simulation of a unit with a power of 100 kW at a rotational frequency of 50 rpm. A multidimensional parametric optimization procedure for magnetic-system geometry has been performed in order to achieve the minimum cost of active materials under a permanent thermal load. The obtained data have made it possible to calculate the maximum specific characteristics of the material consumption for optimized units characterized by a maximum electromagnetic torque per unit volume of the magnetic system and the minimum cost per unit electromagnetic torque. The cost of active materials for the power-generation and transmission systems have been compared for a wind turbine based on an electromagnetic continuously variable transmission and for a direct drive wind turbine. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Clean energy sources like wind energy have been receiving much attention, and great emphasis has been given to the design and optimization of horizontal axis wind turbines, but just as important are the vertical axis wind turbines that can be used for generating energy for small businesses, houses, and buildings. This article sought to study the optimal geometrical parameters of a H-Darrieus vertical axis wind turbine using surrogate-based optimization with three different types of surrogate models and compared them. Airfoil chord and thickness were chosen as the design variables and respective ranges set at 0.32-0.6 m and 0.04-0.16 m. All evaluations are carried out for a tip-speed ratio of 1.5. Three different surrogate models were used and compared, namely a quadratic polynomial response surface, an artificial neural network based on radial basis functions called Extreme Learning Machine and a Kriging interpolator. Surrogates were constructed based on an initial sample data distributed according to a full factorial design. A test set was designed to evaluate the accuracy of the surrogates. Both training and testing data sets were generated using 2D CFD modeling to reduce computational cost. From the test set, Extreme Learning Machine surrogate showed the smallest RMSE of 11.24%, followed by Kriging, at 17.64%, and Response Surface of 22.17%. For the optimal designs the same pattern ensued, with optimal power coefficient overestimated by 8.7% for the response surface surrogate, followed by 3.12% and 2.17% for the Kriging interpolator and the Extreme Learning Machine, respectively. Power coefficient curves comparing the three optimal geometries from each surrogate were calculated and plotted. Optimal turbine obtained from Kriging surrogate optimization process resulted in a 7.92% increase in the Cp, whilst Extreme Learning Machine and Response Surface resulted in a 7.86% and 4.29% increase, respectively, all when compared to baseline CFD model. Concluding guidelines are that the quadratic polynomial response surface may not be the best alternative when dealing with complex non-linear relationships as typically present in VAWT simulations. Superior techniques such as Extreme Learning Machine and Kriging could be more suitable for this application. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents results from an experimental and numerical study of different lift-based and drag-based vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs). One of the main disadvantages of vertical axis wind turbines is the low efficiency and inability to self-starting at low wind speeds. The task of the study is to determine an efficient geometry of the turbine runner, which can generate higher power at the lowest wind speeds. A comparison has been made of the cut-in speed, rated speed, efficiency, and the self-starting capabilities. This work proposes an aerodynamic scheme for wind turbine runners, which can operate relatively more efficiently at low and variable winds. The presented results favour the selection of a wind turbine for operation in conditions of weak and variable wind. The experiments were conducted in the Laboratory of Hydro Power and Hydraulic Turbomachinery (HEHT Lab) at the Technical University of Sofia. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - An urban wind turbine with small scale generator adopts darrieus type vertical blades which make possible to start easily turbine and to produce electricity even under the conditions of weak and irregular winds. The generator for a highly efficient power production should be required, so that the design using a direct-driven permanent magnet synchronous generator has been considered owing to reduction of additional mechanical losses during the power production. In this study, 1 kW-class outer rotor type generator with two stage was proposed, in which an axial-flux permanent magnet was applied to 10 pole/12 slot combination and distributed windings with double layer. Finite element model was prepared by taking into account of single-stage and half geometry of the generator, and then electro-magnetic analysis was carried out to calculate the active powers under given loading conditions and electrical parameters. To meet the requirement of the target specification such as the active power with 250 W, the shape optimal design was conducted, in which 7 design variables were varied and design space was explored under a constraint of weight minimization. As a result, the optimized design variables of the generator were found to satisfy the target specification, and the weight of the generator was maintained at the same level of that for the initial design model. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Tower cost makes up an important part in the whole wind turbine construction especially for offshore wind farms. The main method to reduce tower cost is to reduce tower weight by optimum design. This paper proposes a two-level optimization criterion method for the optimal design of steel conical tower considering different structural reliability and uncertainty, along with the discreteness of design variables such as tower thickness and bolt type. In the first level, the tower shell geometry can be obtained by section design method; in the second level, bolted connections and flanges are designed based on the results of the first level. Then, summarized analysis and iterative calculation is performed to obtain optimum tower design with constant strength and rigidness. This method will play an important role in offshore customized turbine design. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - A numerical procedure was developed to determine a variable-pitch law that maximized the performance of a vertical-axis wind turbine (VAWT). The methodology was based on the determination, for each blade, of the angle of attack maximizing the stationary aerodynamic efficiency at prescribed azimuthal positions. The angles of attack were determined by means of a panel method with a low computational effort, and the methodology was implemented in Matlab (Formula presented.) software (version R2021a) allowing us to achieve in real time a variable-pitch law suitable for the turbine geometry. The variable pitch law was validated by considering its effect on the torque of a 2D model of an H-Darrieus turbine. U-RANS analyses were carried out with a (Formula presented.) model and a sliding-mesh technique was used to prescribe the blade motion around the shaft and pitch motion. Results showed how the variable-pitch law delayed the dynamic stall and improved the aerodynamic performance considerably. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The work discusses the effect of geometric modifications of a tension leg platform hull. Understanding the role of these alterations can help to adapt the platform to different installation sites. The investigation is carried out through resizing hull components individually. The system is a free-float capable tension leg platform with a 10MW wind turbine. Initially, the wind turbine and the platform are described. The assessment methodology is presented, and the sets of geometrical variables are defined. The influence of the variations is evaluated by checking the natural periods, platform mass, and the mooring line tension losses. The study examines which particular element size leads to better dynamics in the transportation and operation phases. Accordingly, the final design is selected, and the impacts of each component are recapped. The upper columns diameter is concluded to be the main contributor to an improved mooring performance in extreme conditions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The IEC standards describe how to measure the power performance of an isolated wake-free wind turbine. However, most wind turbines operate under waked conditions for a substantial amount of time, calling for the need of a new methodology for power performance evaluation. We define multivariate power curves in the form of multivariate polynomial regressions, whose input variables are several wind speed and turbulence measurements retrieved with nacelle lidars. We use a dataset of synthetic power performance tests including both waked and wake-free conditions. The dataset is generated through aeroelastic simulations combined with both virtual nacelle lidars and the dynamic wake meandering model. A feature-selection algorithm is used to select the input variables among the available measurements, showing that the optimal model includes four input variables: three correspondent to wind speed and one to turbulence measures. Additionally, we give insights on the optimal nacelle-lidar scanning geometry needed to implement the multivariate power curve. Results show that the multivariate power curves predict the power output with accuracy of the same order under both waked and wake-free operation. For the in-wake cases, the accuracy is much higher than that of the IEC standard power curve, with an error reduction of up to 88%. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The view that drivers have from the road can be enjoyable or disturbing, stressful or relaxing, distracting or fatiguing. Road planning guidelines balance aesthetical and safety considerations but are rarely grounded on empirical evidence. This paper reviews evidence on the effects of the roadside visual environment on the wellbeing and behaviour of drivers, focusing on natural and built elements external to the road, i.e. excluding road geometry, design, conditions, and users. Standardised information was extracted from 50 studies. These studies have used experiments involving participants watching videos or driving a simulator or instrumented vehicle, usually with unrepresentative samples (mostly males, young age groups, and students). Most evidence is related to the driving task (e.g. distraction, fatigue), not to wider aspects of driver wellbeing (e.g. stress recovery), and to safety issues, not aesthetical ones. There is increased evidence for monotonous views (linked to fatigue), roadside vegetation (linked mainly to a reduction of stress and risky driving behaviours, but depending on the characteristics of the vegetation) and advertisements (linked to distraction, but depending on advertisement type and other variables). A few studies have looked at other elements of the built environment (memorials, drones, wind turbines, utility poles), with mixed evidence on distraction and safety behaviour. The links between continued exposure to certain types of views and car commuter stress have not been studied. There is little evidence for developing countries or differences by gender, visual impairment, trip purpose, and type of vehicle. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this article is to expand the general approach of the flexible beam model to consider tapered geometry and anisotropic properties by updating the cross-sectional stiffness matrix. The advantage of this approach is that continuously variable cross-section, as well as irregular axes on the cross-sections, are considered simultaneously by the co-rotational method. Anisotropic and isotropic cantilevered beam cases are simulated. A static force or moment is applied as the external load. NREL 5 MW wind turbine blade is analyzed as a practical example. The results are compared against the existing literature and ABAQUS model, and they show excellent agreement. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Abstract: Development of wind energy has led to explosive growth of practically applied energy sources, combined in wind farms. The number of wind turbines in cold climate grows rapidly. One of major problems in operation of wind turbines in such conditions is icing of turbine blades. It is known that the wind energy industry has no reliable methods for remote diagnostics of icing. Development and improvement of such methods is an extremely relevant task. The aim of the work is elaboration of a multivariable triangulation method for accurate diagnostics of three-dimensional geometry of ice. The idea of the method is as follows. Spatially-structured lighting is repeatedly projected on the surface of object to control. Images of the object are recorded from a direction other than that of the lighting. The images contain the structure of the projected lighting, distorted by the relief of the surface of the object. For each point on the image of the object, the dependence of the intensity of the registered radiation on the number of the image is determined. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The use of fuels produced with renewable electricity from wind and solar energy and with CO<inf>2</inf> from unavoidable sources or directly captured form the air (so called e-Fuels) is of great interest as a proposition for further limiting the climate impact of road transportation. One of the most efficiently producible e-fuels is e-methane. Feeding methane from renewable sources into the gas grid is one of the most promising pathways to achieve carbon neutral road transportation on a well-to-wheel (WTW) basis. Currently, the use of odorants is mandatory in the gas grid. It is common that sulfur compounds are used as odorants, which can lead to sulfur poisoning of the catalytic converters if an internal combustion engine is operated with it. Consequently, desulfurization will be necessary to maintain high catalyst efficiency over lifetime, which will increase the tank-to-wheel (TTW) CO<inf>2</inf> emissions through increased fuel consumption. For desulfurization, it is necessary to increase the catalyst brick temperature to levels above 800 °C. This paper investigates how such high temperatures can be realized and derive implications on engine operation and gas grid regulation. To this end, experimental studies were conducted with a 1-liter 3-cylinder prototype engine from Ford-Werke GmbH featuring variable intake valve timing, a compression ratio of 14 and a turbocharger with variable turbine geometry (VTG). The engine was operated with gas direct injection at up to 16 bar pressure. The ECU software allowed to apply deliberate oscillations of the lambda signal (“wobbling” of the air/fuel ratio) and cylinder individual air/fuel ratios to achieve a sufficient exhaust aftertreatment. The three-way-catalyst for the investigations were particularly suitable for methane operation due to a high palladium loading and increased oxygen storage capacity of the washcoat. Different load points were used for the investigations, ranging from near idle to medium engine speed and load. The catalyst brick temperature was increased considerably by splitting the mean air/fuel ratio between lean and rich operation on different cylinders (so called “lambda spli”), which is limited by the ignition limits of air/methane charges. Furthermore, too extreme lambda split leads to unstable engine operation. Sufficient hydrocarbon reduction can be achieved at a catalyst brick temperature above 500 °C, which cannot be achieved for near idle load points without additional measures (e.g. electrically heated catalyst). Desulfurization of the catalyst requires brick temperatures above 800 °C and is accordingly not achievable with stable engine operation in a significantly large area of the low load operation conditions. In this case additional heating measures (as e.g. electrically heated catalysts or exhaust burner) or vehicle hybridization are required to avoid low load operating conditions and to comply with the emission targets. Furthermore, desulfurization causes 6 % additional CO<inf>2</inf> emissions in the WLTP cycle for C-segment passenger cars. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper developed an optimization procedure using Powell's method with symbolic search variables, so any one or more parameters in structural designs can be optimal. Powell's method was used to determine the optimal Offshore Wind Turbine (OWT) jacket geometry under IEC-61400-3-1 (Wind Turbines-part 3-1, Design requirements for fixed offshore wind turbines. 2019), tropical cyclone, and seismic loads to minimize the structural weight. A linear generator braking system was proposed to stop the rotor under the power production plus occurrence of fault, and analysis results indicate that this braking system can avoid the steel design dominated by this situation. When the soil resistance is strong enough, the three-leg structural type is superior; otherwise, the four-leg one is suggested. The length between two bottom legs of three-leg cases is larger than that of four-leg cases, while the average ratio of the three and four-leg cases can be set to near 1.39. The total required steel mass is roughly linearly proportional to the water depth, and it increases by around 40% from a water depth of 35 m–80 m, so the jacket type can still be used in the deep sea under not only IEC-61400-3-1 loads but also seismic and tropical cyclone loads. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The dynamic characteristics of pipe piles are of considerable importance for the dynamic foundation design of offshore wind turbines. In this study, we develop an analytical model for the lateral vibration of offshore pipe piles with consideration of the inertia effect and axial loading from the superstructure. A coupled dynamic saturated soil–pile interaction model is established based on Biot’s poroelastic theory and Euler–Bernoulli theory. The potential function, operator decomposition method, variable separation method and matrix transfer method are introduced herein to obtain the lateral force of the inner and outer soil acting on the pile shaft. Then, the analytical solution of the pile dynamic impedance in the frequency domain is derived by employing the soil–pile continuous deformation conditions and the boundary conditions of the pile. The rationality and accuracy of the presented solution have were by comparing its results with those predicted by existing solutions. The influence of superstructure, pile geometry and soil plug height on the lateral dynamic impedance and natural frequency of pipe piles was thoroughly investigated based on the theoretical model. The main findings can be summarized as: (1) The dynamic stiffness of piles will be remarkably underestimated if the inertia effect of the superstructure is not accounted for. (2) The vertical load of the superstructure is main factor affecting the natural frequency, whereas the inertia effect of the superstructure will enlarge the resonance amplitude. (3) The overall lateral dynamic impedance and first-order natural frequency of the pile increase significantly with the soil plug height. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Generating a high startup torque is a critical factor for the application of small wind turbines in regions with low wind speed. In the present study, the blades of a small wind turbine were designed and optimized to maximize the output power and startup torque. For this purpose, the chord length and the twist angle were considered as design variables, and a multi-objective optimization study was used to assess the optimal blade geometry. The blade element momentum (BEM) technique was used to calculate the design goals and the genetic algorithm was utilized to perform the optimization. The BEM method and the optimization tools were verified with wind tunnel test results of the base turbine and Schmitz equations, respectively. The results showed that from the aerodynamic viewpoint, the blade of a small wind turbine can be divided into two sections: r/R < 0.52, which is responsible for generating the startup torque, and r/R ≥ 0.52, where most of the turbine power is generated. By increasing the chord length and twist angle (especially chord length) in the r/R < 0.52 section and following the ideal chord length and twist angle distributions in the r/R ≥ 0.52 part, a 140% rise in the startup torque of the designed blade was observed with only a 1.5% reduction in power coefficient, compared with the base blade. Thereby, the startup wind speed was reduced from 6 m/s for the base blade to 4 m/s for the designed blade, which provides greater possibilities for the operation of this turbine in areas with lower wind speeds. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The MDAO framework has become an essential part of almost all fields, apart from mechanical, transportation, and aerospace industries, for efficient energy conversion or otherwise. It enables rapid iterative interaction among several engineering disciplines at various fidelities using automation tools for design improvement. An advanced framework from low to high fidelity is developed for ducted and unducted turbomachinery blade designs. The parametric blade geometry tool is a key feature which converts low-fidelity results into 3D blade shapes and can readily be used in high-fidelity multidisciplinary simulations as part of an optimization cycle. The geometry generator and physics solvers are connected to DAKOTA, an open-source optimizer with parallel computation capability. The entire cycle is automated and new design iterations are generated with input parameter variations controlled by DAKOTA. Single- and multi-objective genetic algorithm and gradient method-based optimization cases are demonstrated for various applications. B-splines are used to define smooth perturbation of parametric variables chordwise and spanwise of the blade. The ability to create parametric 3D blade shapes quickly from low-fidelity analyses with advanced control is demonstrated to be unique and enables a rapid 3D design cycle. Non-intuitive designs are feasible in this framework and designers can really benefit from parametric geometry manipulation. Optimization at each fidelity is realized through automation. As part of the multidisciplinary analysis, 3D structural analysis is also performed using the unidirectional fluid–structure interaction for a few cases with imported pressure loads from the 3D RANS solution. Examples of axial turbofans, compressor rotors, turbines, radial compressors, propellers, wind and hydrokinetic turbines are demonstrated to prove generality. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This work aims to apply the multi-objective optimization method to gas turbine part-load energy-saving and NOx (Nitrogen Oxides) emission reduction problem. For power generation gas turbines, energy-saving is based on raising the thermal efficiency of the system. This is always based on regulating the variable geometries of the plant. However, in this process, the combustion condition would be changed, which would further change the NOx pollutant emission level. Therefore, in this paper, the conflict between gas turbine thermal efficiency enhancement and NOx emission reduction is discovered and analyzed with a nonlinear model. To solve this multi-objective optimization problem, GA (Genetic Algorithm), a global optimization algorithm, is applied. The two objectives are thermal efficiency for energy-saving and NOx Emission Index (EINOx) for pollution reduction. The fuel mass flow rate and compressor Inlet Guide Vane (IGV) position are the decision variables. Optimization is conducted for 50% to 90% nominal power levels and 5 °C to 25 °C ambient temperatures. With the non-inferior solutions on the Pareto Front and a trade-off decision, the selected gas turbine optimum working point can be obtained with a nonlinear converter module. For 15 °C, 70% nominal power working condition, increasing the fuel mass flow rate by 0.216% and IGV degree by 10.344% can bring a 46.273% reduction of EINOx, with the cost of a 0.212% decline in the thermal efficiency. The sensitivity analysis of the Pareto Frontiers to power level and ambient temperature is carried out. Then the level of energy-saving is analyzed by calculating the cost of fuel, and a trade-off suggestion is given. In the end, the values of the decision variables and objective functions under three trade-off scenarios are calculated and listed in a table, with which the final solution can be decided conveniently according to practical demands. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This work presents a high-fidelity shape optimization framework based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The presented work is the first comprehensive curved tip shape study of a wind turbine rotor to date using a direct CFD-based approach. Preceding the study is a thorough literature survey particularly focused on wind turbine blade tips in order to place the present work in its context. Then follows a comprehensive analysis to quantify mesh dependency and to present needed mesh modifications ensuring a deep convergence of the flow field at each design iteration. The presented modifications allow the framework to produce up to six-digit-accurate finite difference gradients which are verified using the machine-accurate Complex-Step method. The accurate gradients result in a tightly converged design optimization problem in which the studied problem is to maximize power using 12 design variables while satisfying constraints on geometry, as well as on the bending moment at 90% blade length. The optimized shape has about 1% r/R blade extension, 2% r/R flapwise displacement, and slightly below 2% r/R edgewise displacement resulting in a 1.12% increase in power. Importantly, the inboard part of the tip is de-loaded using twist and chord design variables as the blade is extended, ensuring that the baseline steady-state loads are not exceeded. For both analysis and optimization an industrial-scale mesh resolution of above 14×106 cells is used, which underlines the maturity of the framework. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - When designing a wind turbine, the main objective is to generate maximum effective power with the lowest possible production costs. The power of a wind turbine depends primarily on the aerodynamic properties of its blades. Moreover, the cost of making a blade for a wind turbine, and therefore also for the entire wind turbine, depends on the materials used for its production. Therefore, wind turbine blades are the most studied element of a wind turbine. By selecting the optimal material and geometric properties of the wind turbine blade, it is possible to reduce the costs of making the entire wind turbine. These rationales led the authors to investigate composite wind turbine blades. A two-criteria optimization task was formulated, which allowed for the simultaneous consideration of two criteria: minimizing the mass and minimizing the vertical deflection of the wind turbine blade. Geometric properties of the blade, influencing the considered criteria, were assumed as decision variables. The weighted sum method was used. The results obtained allowed us to determine the optimal geometric and material properties of a wind turbine blade. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - A dual-objective optimization study was carried out to illuminate how the tip speed ratio of a small wind turbine affects the aerodynamic noise as well as the blade geometry. A 0.75 kW three-bladed small horizontal axis wind turbine was selected as the case study. Two important goals were considered in the study: maximization of the output power and the minimization of the aerodynamic noise. The former was calculated by the well-known blade-element momentum theory while a validated semi-empirical model was adopted for the computation of the latter. A combination of these goals defined the objective function and the weighted-sum approach was employed to find the optimal values for the design variables of the optimization including the distributions of the chord and the twist angle along the blade together with the tip speed ratio. The extracted power was calculated at the rated wind speed of 10 m/s while the noise was computed at lower wind speeds of 5 and 7.5 m/s. The genetic algorithm technique was adopted for the muti-objective optimization. The results revealed the importance of the blade tip region in producing the emitted aerodynamic noise. Specifically, an increase in the chord and twist values near the tip results in the reduction in the emitted noise. Results also show that a good compromise between the two goals is achievable such that a noticeable reduction in the emitted aerodynamic noise is attainable in exchange for a very small drop in the power coefficient. The optimization results also indicated that the noise could be adequately reduced at the smaller value of the tip speed ratio without a large reduction in output power which is due to the decrease in the rotational speed of the turbine. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The goal of any multidisciplinary design optimization problem for wind power plants is to reduce the overall levelized cost of the energy. When it comes to designing a wind farm, one has to find the best combination of multiple parameters, such as turbine types, turbine dimensions and farm layout, to ensure the minimum cost. Clearly, since any design parameter may affect several cost items and performance indices of a farm, the most cost-effective solution should handle the mutual coupling among all design variables. For example, increasing the turbine spacing surely has a positive impact on energy production due to the minimization of wake losses, but, at the same time, may have a detrimental impact on the cost of cabling. In order to assist multidisciplinary design activities for wind farms and wind turbines, the present work is aimed at developing a tool for preliminary estimation of the levelized cost of energy of land- and sea-based wind farms. Such a tool is based on a modular architecture, which will ease the integration of the tool in a multi-level design framework. Each module of the tool implements one or more engineering models to estimate all cost items along with the annual energy production of the farm, starting from a few pieces of information related to turbine types and dimensions, farm geometry and wind conditions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Neural network models have been widely applied in wind energy to enable data-driven modelling of turbine's power, loads, damage, and other quantities in wind farm. They have shown advantages in the flexibility, robustness, and efficiency, as well as the ease of application. An important task in data-driven modelling of wind farm is the characterization of wake-induced effects within wind farm. Because of the large number of wind turbines in wind farm and the broad range of conditions required for power output assessment, it has become relevant to use computationally efficient surrogate models that are based on parameterizations of the wind farm layout. Previous studies on surrogate models of wake-induced effects have focused on parameterizations based on manually extracted features from the wind farm geometry. The present study applies an autoencoder neural network to automatically learn the features representing the wind farm layout. Specifically, two autoencoders are studied and compared. The autoencoder provides dimension reduction and feature learning that allow representing the entire wind farm layout in just a few latent variables, thus allowing efficient and accurate surrogate models of wake-induced effects. The outputs of the autoencoder, together with any ambient wind condition variables, serve as inputs to a standard feedforward neural network that predicts the wake-induced effects for any turbine in the wind farm. Our results show that the autoencoder provides an automatic and effective way to parameterize the wind farm geometry, and facilitates the building of efficient surrogate models that are capable of accurate modeling of wake-induced effects in a wind farm with arbitrary layout. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Floater motions introduce unsteadiness in the aerodynamics of floating offshore wind turbines. The aerodynamics of a wind turbine after three perturbations are studied: a blade pitch step, a rotor speed step for which dynamic inflow is expected, and a surge velocity step. The free vortex wake method and an analytical helical vortex model based on the Joukowsky rotor model are used to study the dynamic behavior of the induced velocity at the blades. As expected, the dynamic inflow effect is clear for the blade pitch and rotor speed changes, but for a surge velocity step, the models show that very little dynamic inflow effect takes place because the velocity induced by the vortex helix is not significantly modified: the tip vortex helix circulation change is partially compensated by the geometry change of the helix. For the rate of change, the velocities induced on the rotor by the vortex helix for the pitch and rotor speed changes show a rapid adjustment at the blade tip, with a slower change throughout the rest of the blade and at the center of the rotor. The convection velocity of the tip vortices is shown to be the main variable of the temporal evolution of the dynamic inflow effect. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Wind turbine airfoil operates in the atmosphere with uncertain turbulence and relatively low Reynolds number all year round. Meanwhile, due to the complexity of blade airfoil fabrication, there are inevitable geometric deviations to the theoretical airfoil shape. These uncertainties from manufacturing and operating environment couple together and lead to performance degradation. In the traditional wind turbine airfoil design process, the uncertainties are not the design variables, objectives, and constraints are deterministic. This paper presents a novel approach for uncertain analysis and aerodynamic robustness optimization of wind turbine airfoil considering turbulence and geometric error uncertainties. An interval method coupled with the Kriging model is applied to quantify the uncertain influence, and is integrated in the optimization. The target of optimization is to find an optimal airfoil with low sensitivity to uncertainties, as well as maintaining lift to drag ratio. After optimization the min std best airfoil shows 17.96% reduction of fluctuation range and no decreased average of lift to drag ratio compared to the baseline airfoil. The optimization was validated through flow field analysis by non-deterministic CFD approach. The proposed methodology can be further applied to other engineering designs making product less sensitivity to uncertainties thus more reliable. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Based on a certain 150 kW variable-speed variable pitch blade, a blade tip profile with arc-shaped forward bending in the direction of the incoming wind and increased torsion angle is proposed to reduce load. The influences of torsion angle increment, bending angle and wind speed on the aerodynamic characteristics of the blade are comprehensively considered, thus a 4×4×4 group of orthogonal experimental geometry models are established. After that, the flow field analysis is completed by the Fluent rotating coordinate system method, with which the parameters such as moment and thrust of each group are obtained. Comparing the simulation results of 16 sets of models, the factor effects are used to evaluate the influence of wind speed, bending angle and torsion angle increment on the aerodynamic characteristics of the blade. The main conclusions are as follows: the proposed tip shape has no obvious effect on the blade's aerodynamic characteristics at wind speed that is far below or above the rated wind speed. Under the rated wind speed of 9 m/s, the blade tip with 10° torsion angle increment and 30° bending angle has the best load reduction characteristics compared with the initial blade, and the axial thrust is reduced by about 6.5% without power loss. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This work presents an optimization procedure through the variation of the sweep curve of a two bladed Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine (HAWT), previously tested by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The steady-state simulation was conducted using unstructured mesh on the whole domain, using a MRF around the rotor. The turbulence model was the k-ωSST. Moreover, a grid independence study was carried out, as well as a validation with experimental data from NREL Phase VI, using the moment as the control variable, whereby it was concluded that the numerical method was validated for a range of wind speeds from 5 m/s to 15 m/s. In addition, an optimization routine was made, aiming to maximize the power coefficient (C<inf>p</inf>) of the blades, by means of introducing the sweep curve on the blades. The parameters of sweep, such as radial position of sweep start, maximum displacement of the tip and the exponent of the curve, were chosen as the design variables, and a NSGA-II algorithm was used to do the optimization. Two optimized geometries of the blade were obtained, for the point of maximum C<inf>p</inf> one with forward sweep with an increase of 4.49% on the power coefficient; and another one with backward sweep, with an increase of 5.62% on the power coefficient. Moreover, both geometries yielded greater power coefficients for all wind speeds between 10 m/s and 15 m/s, reaching a maximum of 18% increase in the power coefficient, for a wind speed of 14 m/s, maintaining the robustness of the stall regulated HAWT. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The effective implementation of nearly zero energy buildings requires the use of proper energy technologies as well as the use of smart and efficient energy management systems. This work shows the main results of the European project Re-COGNITION, which tackles both aspects. In terms of technologies, the development of a biogas-fuelled micro cogeneration unit, a lightweight glass-free photovoltaic modules, a passive variable geometry small wind turbine, a latent heat thermal storage based on phase change materials and a hybrid solar cooling systems is presented. In addition, two tools for the optimal design and the optimal operation of the building energy system are considered. The full infrastructure is applied to various pilots (Turin (IT), Corby (UK), Thessaloniki (GR), Cluj-Napoca (RO)). The main technological advancements and the preliminary simulation results are discussed. It is shown that optimal exploitation of new technologies through optimization strategies provide significant benefits in terms of reductions of costs and emissions. The analysis in this paper is mainly focused on the use of an innovative thermal storage unit. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Buildings are the largest end-use sector, followed by transport, industry, and agriculture. For this reason, decarbonising residential and non-residential buildings is crucial to reach Europe's carbon neutrality by 2050. The key elements in meeting the challenge of achieving carbon neutral buildings are: a) maximising local energy production from multiple renewable energy technologies, b) matching local demand and supply energy flows, c) reducing capital costs of technologies at building level. A two-stage stochastic model is performed to define the optimal synthesis, design and operation of an energy system under uncertainty. More in detail, decisions at synthesis and design level are taken in the first stage, while decisions at operating level are handled in the second one. The integrated system for the building environment is composed of both less mature renewable technologies (e.g., biogas-based micro combined heat and power unit, variable geometry vertical axis wind turbine, latent heat thermal storage, etc.) and more established technologies. Due to the low technology readiness level, the design optimization is performed considering the investment costs of the innovative technologies and the biogas price as uncertain parameters. The building taken as reference is the Energy Center, a tertiary building in an urban context located in Turin (Italy). Application of the proposed methodology defines whether the integration of the additional novel technologies results in cost and emission reductions. Defined the optimal design, a comparison between the actual energy system of the building and the optimal one selected by the stochastic optimization are compared. Results show that some innovative technologies are selected for the optimal design, showing cost reduction up to 35% and emission reduction up to 27%. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Offshore wind energy is evolving worldwide. Very often, impact-driven monopiles are used as foundations for offshore wind turbines. However, driving piles into the seabed causes very high underwater sound pressure levels, which might endanger animals living in the sea. Therefore, several prediction methods for the occurring underwater sound pressure levels from pile driving have been developed in the past years. Furthermore, different noise mitigation systems exist to decrease the noise emission into the water. Additional knowledge of the sound source, i.e., the driven pile, would simplify predictions and help the development of impact hammers or piles emitting less noise. The present paper applies findings from the theory of axisymmetric vibrations of cylindrical shells as well as their sound radiation to the field of offshore pile driving. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This work will demonstrate structural optimization of large offshore wind turbine blades. Offset in taken in a state-of-the-art commercial wind turbine blade, and the objective is to minimize its mass under critical structural and manufacturing criteria. Finite element models of the root-to-max-chord segment are built taking blade geometry, material layup and loads as input. It is chosen only to model this segment, as the majority of material is placed here. As such, the size of the analysis model is reduced for optimization. The finite element models will demonstrate optimization with both shell and solid-shell elements as well as combinations hereof. The structure is parametrized with layer thicknesses as design variables, which are assigned to patches to reduce the number of design variables. This paper will show preliminary analysis results, and the optimization results will be presented at the conference. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Classical Savonius-type wind turbines (SWT) with semi-circular blades were shown to achieve peak power coefficient (efficiency or c<inf>P</inf>) up to 25% [1]. The peak power coefficient values were achieved only at relatively high Reynolds number (Re>800k). This was initially shown only using wind-tunnel investigations, and these results were strengthened by many subsequent numerical studies which have shown good correlation with the experimental data. In recent SWT research, the objective is mostly related to increasing relatively low SWT efficiency. One of the notable SWT blade shape modifications to show significant improvement was proposed by Bach and Benes in [2]–[4]. The modified blade shape was composed a straight part in the inner rotor part and a circular-arc (spanning less than 180°) on the outer part. The peak power coefficient was increased from 22% to 28%. Different recent studies attempted further improvement using complex curves such as elliptical [5], spline [6] or multiple smaller quarter [7], with no major improvement. A major improvement was achieved in numerical shape-optimization studies with the novel "scooplet-based" SWT [8] with efficiency increased to 37% using 2D CFD and 34% using 3D CFD [9]. In previous numerical studies, the Reynolds number is usually fixed at relatively large values near Re=1M. However, this number is difficult to achieve in small-scale wind tunnels. In the current study, an experimental study of the optimized SWT turbine was performed in low-speed wind tunnel at Reynolds number 130k. The experiments were first performed for the classical SWT for which the expected results are known from previous studies. The improvement of the novel desing was then measured relative to the classical SWT design. The experiments were performed at a fixed wind velocity equal to v=5.6 m/s. The rotor diameter in all cases was D=0.36m (r=0.18m) and height H=0.4m. The rotational speed ω was controlled using a DC generator connected to variable resistor. The tip speed ratio (TSR=rω/v) was varied between TSR=0.5 and TSR=1.25. The electrical power was measured from the generated current (I) and the voltage (U) over resistor. The static mechanical torque (T<inf>0</inf>) was measured independently of the electrical power, and the estimated aerodynamic power was calculated by P=UI/η+T<inf>0</inf>ω. The main unknown is related to generator efficiency η. However, the same setup was used for measuring both turbine types, so that the relative difference should be reliable. To complement the experimental results, numerical analysis was performed using the same setup as in the experiment. The same 3D CFD model as in [9] was used, but with the geometry matching the performed experiment. For classical SWT, the peak power coefficient at Re=130k was estimated using CFD to be 21% at TSR=0.8. In the experimental data, the highest aerodynamic power also happened to be at TSR=0.8 with c<inf>P</inf>=19%. The peak power coefficient of the novel SWT using CFD was 29% also at TSR=0.8. Meanwhile, the experiment show peak efficiency of 26% at TSR=0.9 (which was only slightly lower at TSR=0.8). This is a 37% relative improvement of the novel design over the classical SWT. The CFD results and previous experimental studies predict that the power coefficient will significantly increase at higher Reynolds number which will be the topic of a future work. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Stochastic nature of some input variables dictates the requisite of probabilistic analysis in power systems operation and planning. Wind generation is considered as a main source of intermittency in power systems due to the uncertain nature of wind speed. The proposed probabilistic optimal power-flow (POPF) method investigates spatial correlation among sources to attain more practical output distributions. The method established reduced-discrete point estimate method (RDPEM) along with the Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) in order to attain the stochastic characteristic of optimization's outputs. Despite needing less computational effort, highly accurate results can be obtained, while there is no prerequisite for probability distribution of the input random variables. In order to more validate the efficiency of the proposed method, the Gram-Charlier (GC) expansion is used to compare the outputs' cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) that are obtained from Monte Carlo (MC) with RDPEM methods. The performance and precision of the proposed solution are ascertained by comparison with those of Monte Carlo with discrete LHS (MCDLHS) in a hybrid IEEE 14-bus test system. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The reconfigurable ducted turbine array concept is an energy harvesting method proposed to reduce the so-called levelized cost of energy extracted from naturally occurring flows (e.g., from wind and water currents.) Duct augmentation is proposed to achieve higher power coefficient than the Betz limit for open turbines, among other (e.g., structural) reasons. Ducted or shrouded hydrokinetic turbines with a contracted throat area can be used to eliminate blade tip vortex, and to potentially increase the flow velocity at the rotor cross-section, consequently speeding up the rotor to improve electro-magnetic efficiency. In a recent paper by the authors, an equivalent circuit model for a single duct was proposed to understand the effects of geometric design variables of the duct. These variables are contraction ratio, aspect ratio, hub-to-throat ratio, etc. The parameterized circuit model was used to study the flow behavior of the ducted geometry in terms of equivalent resistances. The current paper presents an extended equivalent circuit model by adding the effects of turbulence, gravity, and hydrostatic pressure. The unknown parameters of the equivalent circuit model are identified using three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics simulations, and by curve fitting using the least squares method. The circuit model is then used to identify design variables that result in desirable flow behavior from duct augmentation. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Floating structures are viable alternatives for supporting wind turbines in deep water. Design of floating support structures is a challenging task, and a design evaluation requires considerations of costs and system performance. An approach for evaluation of semi-submersible floaters has been developed in this paper. A braceless semi-submersible floater is selected and this floater is designed to support a 5-MW wind turbine in the North Sea. The evaluation framework consists of automatic modeling and numerical simulations in open-source tools. A Python-SALOME-NEMOH interface is used to obtain the hydrodynamic properties for geometries defined by various variables. The geometries are subjected to three performance constraints related to the static platform pitch, metacentric height, nacelle acceleration and wind loads in operating and parked conditions. Finally, the geometries are evaluated using two combined objective functions related to material cost and nacelle acceleration, and the Pareto Fronts are discussed. This work contributes to developing efficient design optimization methods for floating structures. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Designing a floating offshore wind turbine (FOWT) controller requires solving engineering challenges not found for fixed-bottom turbines. This paper applies several methods from the growing body of FOWT control literature to the 10-MW Ultraflexible Smart FLoating Offshore Wind Turbine (USFLOWT) baseline generator-speed controller. US-FLOWT aims to reduce capital expenses using the lightweight SpiderFLOAT platform, a novel smart floating substructure with built-in distributed actuators for direct platform tilt and heave control. In this work, the USFLOWT baseline controller is improved through detuning and parallel compensation with both blade pitch and generator torque. The SpiderFLOAT platform additionally allows motion compensation through distributed platform actuators. Two proposed SpiderFLOAT actuator types are considered for active platform control: a low-bandwidth actuator that uses variable floater ballast to bring a heeling platform to a steady-state upright position, and a high-bandwidth actuator that dynamically changes the substructure geometry to actively reject transient platform motion. Each control approach is tested for USFLOWT using the open-source aero-hydro-servo-elastic wind turbine simulation tool Open-FAST. Performance results for each approach are compared across a range of above-rated wind speeds, and promising combined approaches are further evaluated to recommend future multi-parameter optimization pathways. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - As energy crisis, climate change, ozone depletion, global warming, and oil price fluctuation continue to increase; the use of renewable energy will become an increasing trend that will affect the next generation of society. However, there is still not enough general understanding about the benefits of using clean energy sources. There is a need to educate communities about sustainable energy to reach a large audience in inventive and effective ways. In this paper, wind energy experiments that can be introduced to Clean Energy Systems classes are described. Three set of variable were examined; number of blades, wind speed, and pitch angle for two different type of blades. How power generation differs from one wind speed to another along with change in number of blades and pitch angle for a given geometry is described. Students performed experimental procedures explained and gained the conceptual understanding of the wind energy better. As the number of blades after adding more than three blades increased, the power generation decreased. As the wind speed increase, the optimal pitch angle needs to be decreased. Therefore, it is significant to see the effect of all variables to the maximum extracted power. The investigations required student explanation of the question, method, display of data with the critical response from peers. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Gear profile deviation is the difference in gear tooth profile from the ideal involute geometry. There are many causes that result in the deviation. Deflection under load, manufacturing, and thermal effects are some of the well-known causes that have been reported to cause deviation of the gear tooth profile. The profile deviation caused by gear tooth profile deformation due to interference-fit assembly has not been discussed previously. Engine timing gear trains, transmission gearboxes, and wind turbine gearboxes are known to use interference-fit to attach the gear to the rotating shaft. This paper discusses the interference-fit joint design and the mechanism of tooth profile deformation due to the interference-fit assembly in gear trains. A new analytical method to calculate the profile slope deviation change due to interference-assembly of parallel axis spur gears is presented. The effectiveness of the proposed computational algorithm to predict the deformation is demonstrated by comparing with measurements. A range of gears varying in size and interference-fit amount are analyzed by using the proposed algorithm to understand the deformation and the effect of the spur gear design variables on it. Finally, the effects of the interference-fit profile deformation and steps to mitigate the effects are discussed, along with gear train testing results and gear measurements of the gear designs that use the proposed methods. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Determining the appropriate location for distributed generation resources to gain the maximum benefits is still a very challenging problem. Most of the losses in power networks happen in the distribution part. Distributed generation units, if placed in appropriate places, in addition to supplying the demand, could help reduce losses and improve voltage profile considerably. In this paper, the optimal placement of wind turbines for improving voltage profile and decreasing losses has been carried out. Since the voltage of the network buses and its losses depends on system load and installed distributed generation resources, it is necessary to determine the status of the distribution system at first then evaluation is done. A wind turbine will have different generation values depending on the speed of the wind that varies in different hours of a year. So, it is necessary to perform optimal placement for obtaining the optimum solution (improving voltage profile and reducing losses) considering the uncertainty of two variables, wind turbine generation, and network load by probabilistic assessment. In this paper, for reducing calculation and keeping the desired accuracy, the Latin Hypercube Sampling has been used. Also, there is a correlation between wind turbine generation and network load variables. Taking this correlation into account will make the simulations more realistic that is realized by the Cholesky decomposition method. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This work presents the results of the development of a vertical axis wind turbine composed of variable geometry, plane blades, applied in operations with low wind speeds. The new concept of vertical axis wind turbine with variable opening blades is presented as an innovative prototype where mechanical details are important for the natural control of the openings of the blades. Theoretical, numerical and experimental analyzes are performed in the turbine called DEC® with the aim of determining the aerodynamic characteristics. An analysis of the behavior of the DEC® turbine consists of a numerical study carried out to calculate or drag coefficient, considering a range of opening positions of the opening at each moment to determine the power coefficient. A second numerical approach is to analyze the moment caused by the interaction between all the turbine blades, in which the effects of energy dissipation caused by the flow mats are considered. Then, the theoretical, numerical results are validated by tests performed using a model in the open wind tunnel, where the prototype is subjected to different wind speeds while maintaining rotation control. Suggestions are made to improve the mechanical and aerodynamic design of the innovative prototype. Finally, the DEC® turbine is expected to serve as an inspiration for creating other mechanical forms of passive or active control to improve variable aerodynamics applied in low-speed conditions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Since several variables in the atmospheric boundary layer differ remarkably as a function of height, small and large wind turbine scales have very distinct operating conditions. Although various advancements took place in the large-scale wind-farms industry leading to strong designs, small-scale counterparts remain still under studied. It is therefore important to design efficient small-scale wind turbines for satisfactory power outputs while operating at low wind speeds. This study carries out multi-fidelity modeling and optimization of a Small-Scale Wind Turbine (SSWT) with a rotor diameter of 50cm, including 3D rotating geometry flow simulation. The blade shape effect on the turbine output is assessed. Both rectangular and tapered blade configurations are studied and the flow around the rotating turbines is investigated along with the blade stresses and the performance output for each configuration. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Renewable energy is a safe and limitless energy source that can be utilized for heating, cooling, and other purposes. Wind energy is one of the most important renewable energy sources. Power fluctuation of wind turbines occurs due to variation of wind velocity. A wind cube is used to decrease power fluctuation and increase the wind turbine's power. The optimum design for a wind cube is the main contribution of this work. The decisive design parameters used to optimize the wind cube are its inner and outer radius, the roughness factor, and the height of the wind turbine hub. A Gradient-Based Optimizer (GBO) is used as a new metaheuristic algorithm in this problem. The objective function of this research includes two parts: The first part is to minimize the probability of generated energy loss, and the second is to minimize the cost of the wind turbine and wind cube. The Gradient-Based Optimizer (GBO) is applied to optimize the variables of two wind turbine types and the design of the wind cube. The metrological data of the Red Sea governorate of Egypt is used as a case study for this analysis. Based on the results, the optimum design of a wind cube is achieved, and an improvement in energy produced from the wind turbine with a wind cube will be compared with energy generated without a wind cube. The energy generated froma wind turbine with the optimized cube is more than 20 times that of a wind turbine without a wind cube for all cases studied. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents a feasibility analysis of vertical wake steering for floating turbines by differential ballast control. This new concept is based on the idea of pitching the floater with respect to the water surface, thereby achieving a desired tilt of the turbine rotor disk. The pitch attitude is controlled by moving water ballast among the columns of the floater. This study considers the application of differential ballast control to a conceptual 10 MW wind turbine installed on two platforms, differing in size, weight, and geometry. The analysis considers the following: (a) the aerodynamic effects caused by rotor tilt on the power capture of the wake-steering turbine and at various downstream distances in its wake; (b) the effects of tilting on fatigue and ultimate loads, limitedly to one of the two turbine-platform layouts; and (c) for both configurations, the necessary amount of water movement, the time to achieve a desired attitude, and the associated energy expenditure. Results indicate that – in accordance with previous research – steering the wake towards the sea surface leads to larger power gains than steering it towards the sky. Limitedly to the structural analysis conducted on one of the turbine-platform configurations, it appears that these gains can be obtained with only minor effects on loads, assuming a cautious application of vertical steering only in benign ambient conditions. Additionally, it is found that rotor tilt can be achieved on the order of minutes for the lighter of the two configurations, with reasonable water ballast movements. Although the analysis is preliminary and limited to the specific cases considered here, results seem to suggest that the concept is not unrealistic and should be further investigated as a possible means to achieve variable tilt control for vertical wake steering in floating turbines. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Non-prismatic beams are widely employed in several engineering fields, e.g., wind turbines, rotor blades, aircraft wings, and arched bridges. While analytical solutions for variable cross-section beams are desirable, a model describing all stress components for beams with general variation of their cross-section under generalised loading remains an open and important problem to solve. To partly address this issue, we propose an analytical solution for stress recovery of untwisted, asymmetric, non-prismatic beams with smooth and continuous taper shape under general loading, considering plane stress conditions for isotropic materials undergoing small strains. The methodology follows Jourawski's formulation, including the effect of asymmetric variable cross-section, with internal forces as known variables. We confirm the non-triviality of the stress field of non-prismatic beams, i.e., the dependency on all internal forces and beam geometry to shear and transverse stress distributions. As a particular novelty, the new formulation for transverse direct stress includes internal forces derivatives, resulting in greater accuracy than state-of-the-art models for distributed loading conditions. Also, closed-form solutions are introduced for non-prismatic and linearly tapered, generally asymmetric beams, both with rectangular cross-sections. For validation purposes, we consider three different practical beam models: a symmetric and an asymmetric, both linearly tapered, and an arched beam. The results, checked against commercial finite element analysis, show that the proposed model predicts the stress-field of non-prismatic beams under distributed loads with good levels of accuracy. Traction-free boundary condition requirements are naturally satisfied on the beam surfaces. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Wind turbines suffer with the degradation of blades during their working life as a result of weathering or adhesion of dirt on their surface. This decreases efficiency in the energy production, requiring in some cases the exchange, repair or cleaning of the blades surfaces, which causes a decrease in the capacity factor of the wind farm due to the machinery shutdown and the increase in the operation cost of the farm. In this paper, we analyse different strategies of how to deal with this issue in the wind turbine design phase. The genetic and simplex optimization algorithms were employed to design the geometry of the blades of two different turbines, one which operates with fixed speed and another which operates with variable speed. The objective function was to maximize the annual energy production (AEP). For each of the turbines, we have designed two different blades: one which is optimal for smooth blade surface and another which is optimal for rough blade surface. The four designs were then tested (using a blade element momentum code) considering smooth and rough surface conditions; in order to assess the difference in performance, the turbines would have taken into account their entire working life. The comparisons were made using an index we have developed for this work: the ratio of the average AEP of the turbine with the blades designed for smooth surface condition and the average AEP of the turbine with the blades designed for rough surface condition. This index was calculated for 0 to 100% of the turbine life working with rough blade surface, for both turbines (fixed and variable speed). The conclusion was that, for the turbine with fixed speed, designing for rough blades is better when the turbine operates with rough blade surface for 34.95% or more of its lifespan. On the other hand, for the turbine with variable speed, designing for rough blades is better only if the turbine works with rough blade surface for 50.59% or more of its lifespan. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Prestressed concrete floaters are gaining growing interest for floating wind turbines, while different material properties can affect the characteristics of floater motions and the range of suitable floater geometries. In this study, a basic geometry of a semi-submersible floater for 10MW is designed, based on which sensitivity study of the material property on floater design is conducted. It was found that minimum floater pitch angles achieved by selecting the optimum floater geometries were similar for the three types of material, while larger values of geometrical variables were required for concrete floaters than for steel floaters for a floater pitch limitation. If larger wall thickness was to be required for concrete structures due to, for example, corrosion protection and crack limitation, generally larger side column width and lower hull length were required for concrete floaters. As the sensitivity of pitch angle to the wall thickness was more affected by wind excitation than wave excitation for normal concrete, it is indicated that the design space for the length of hull can be widened by combining the design with the wind turbine controller methods in the treatment of the maximum thrust force. Lightweight concrete had advantages over normal concrete in the lower center of gravity. The raw material cost of lightweight concrete was higher than normal concrete but significantly lower than steel floaters. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The prestressed concrete–steel hybrid (PCSH) wind turbine tower, characterized by replacing the lower part of the traditional full-height steel tube wind turbine tower with a prestressed concrete (PC) segment, provides a potential alterative solution to transport difficulties and risks associated with traditional steel towers in mountainous areas. This paper proposes an optimization approach with a parallel updated particle swarm optimization (PUPSO) algorithm which aims at minimizing the objective function of the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of the PCSH wind turbine towers in a life cycle perspective which represents the direct investments, labor costs, machinery costs, and the maintenance costs. Based on the constraints required by relevant specifications and industry standards, the geometry of a PCSH wind turbine tower for a 2 MW wind turbine is optimized using the proposed approach. The dimensions of the PCSH wind turbine tower are treated as optimization variables in the PUPSO algorithm. Results show that the optimized PCSH wind turbine tower can be an economic alternative for wind farms with lower LCOE requirements. In addition, compared with the traditional particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and UPSO algorithm, the proposed PUPSO algorithm can enhance the optimization computation efficiency by about 60–110%. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The hydropower sector has recently raised the interest in pump as turbine (PaT) that can be a valid trade-off between capital cost and performance in micro-scale installations. Nevertheless, the modest efficiency of PaTs often restricts their exploitation. In this paper, available experimental data are used to tune a numerical model which aims to investigate the effect of the pump cutwater design on the PaT performance to improve the hydraulic efficiency. Because of its finite thickness, the cutwater interferes with the flow at the runner inlet, and generates local flaws in the velocity field such as swirl and deviations of the streamlines which limit the machine performance. To identify the geometrical characteristics of the cutwater impacting on the PaT performances, different values of stretching and thickness of the cutwater are studied at variable inclination by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. A multivariate regression method is applied on the CFD results to build a surrogate model of the PaT hydraulic characteristics as a function of the geometrical parameters of the machine cutwater. Based on this model, an optimization problem is solved to identify the most advantageous geometrical asset of the PaT cutwater to maximize the efficiency. The results highlight that the length and the cutwater angle are the most affecting variables in favouring a tangential component at the entrance of the runner. The hydraulic efficiency peak of the optimized geometry results to be 86.3%, while the baseline configuration records an efficiency of 82.4%, and the Ψ−ϕ characteristic moves the best efficiency point towards higher head (+7.5%) and lower discharge (−13.0%). The proposed methodology allows identifying the best geometrical characteristics of the PaT cutwater to maximize the performances while significantly reducing the computational time. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper proposes a paradigm shift in the numerical simulation approach to predict rain erosion damage on wind turbine blades, given the blade geometry, its coating material, and the atmospheric conditions (wind and rain) expected at the installation site. Contrary to what has been done so far, numerical simulations (flow field and particle tracking) are used not to study a specific (wind and rain) operating condition but to build a large database of possible operating conditions of the blade section. A machine learning algorithm, trained on this database, defines a prediction module that gives the feature of the impact pattern over the 2-D section, given the wind and rain flow. The advantage of this approach is that the prediction becomes much faster than using the standard simulations; thus, the study of a large set of variable operating conditions becomes possible. The module, coupled with an erosion model, is used to compute the erosion damage of the blade working on specific installation site. In this way, the variations of the flow conditions due to dynamic effects such as variable wind, wind turbulence, and turbine control can be also considered in the erosion computation. Here, we describe the method, the database creation, and the development of the prediction tool. Then, the method is applied to predict the erosion damage on a blade section of a reference wind turbine, after one year of operation in a rainy onshore site. Results are in good agreement with on field observations, showing the potential of the approach. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - An experimental study is presented on the performance of a vertical axis wind turbine with variable blade geometry of the design developed by Austin Farrah. This is experimentally compared with the performance of a correspondingly sized Bach-type Savonius turbine using the same electrical generator and measurement instrumentation in a wind tunnel. Experiments were performed for Reynolds numbers, based on blade chord, in the range 5 × 103 to 1 × 105, and for blade settings between −40° and +40o. The study shows that for the tip speed ratios that have been investigated, the Farrah vertical axis wind turbine design can only marginally outperform a corresponding two-bladed Bach-type Savonius turbine and then only when its blades are set to 40° pitch angle. The presence of a small inner cylinder, which rotates with the turbine, does not enhance its performance due to the fact that it is immersed in an extensive column of relatively static air. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Two sets of experiments in the St. Anthony Falls Laboratory (SAFL) wave tank facility and atmospheric wind tunnel are integrated to provide a scaled representation of a floating wind turbine under heave and pitch motions due to ocean waves. The quasi-coupling is established by controlling the turbine rotor speed to generate a thrust force mimicking steady or fluctuating wind gusts in the wave tank, and by using two actuators to oscillate a miniature turbine in the wind tunnel. Measured pitch and heave motions under varying waves are scaled down using rotor geometry and the wake meandering frequency to study the effect of the floating platform kinematics on the evolution and characteristics of the oscillating turbine wake. For a limited case of experimental conditions results provide a phenomenological and quantitative description of the floating-turbine system under variable waves and simulated wind gusts. Specifically, we demonstrate that wind gusts contribute to increase the platform pitch range, and that periodic large scale flow patches of high and low momentum flow are generated by the oscillating rotor in the turbulent boundary layer and are coherently convected through the wake. Both mechanisms could amplify the pitch response of downwind floating turbine units within the offshore power plant, in particular if the wave and/or wind forcing frequencies happen to approach the pitch natural frequency of the floating system. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Piles and suction caissons are the most common foundation solutions for fixed Offshore Wind Turbines at intermediate water depths. They are generally used as a single element, presenting large diameters and short aspect ratios. These specific dimensions drastically differ from the ones of classical applications (offshore platforms, bridges, tall buildings etc.). Thus, in this paper the validity of their modelling as beam elements for the particular problem of OWT is revised. The results of a soil-beam model, based on the integral Reciprocity Theorem in Elastodynamics and specific Green's functions for the layered half-space for the soil behaviour coupled with Timoshenko's beam Finite Elements, are benchmarked against the ones of a soil-shell model, based on Boundary Elements for the soil coupled with shell Finite Elements. The comparative study is conducted in terms of foundation characterization variables (impedance functions and kinematic interaction factors). Their influence on the OWT seismic response is also studied through a substructuring procedure. From the results, some expressions for determining the applicability range of the beam simplification are proposed as functions of the relative foundation-soil stiffness ratio. It is observed that this applicability range goes beyond that the one commonly considered. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study was conducted theoretically with the aim of investigating the effect of the straight blade angle change on the aerodynamic performance of the vertical axis wind rotor (VAWR). The work was done within the blade angle range of 25°-85° with an angular gradient of 20°. A special name has been given to the VAWR concerned in this paper, where it was called Straight Slant Blades (SSBs). The so-called multi-stream tube (MST) model was modified to be suitable for SSBs. MST is an aerodynamic model, which was previously used to work on what is known as Darrieus and H-Darrieus vertical axis wind turbines. A computer program is designed and developed using Microsoft Visual Basic to be consistent with the objectives of this research. As for verifying the effectiveness of this program, its theoretical results were compared with previous laboratory results from other research studies as it proved its effectiveness in achieving satisfactory results commensurate with the objective of this study. This study is applied to four groups of different engineering designs for the SSB rotor, where each group is concerned with one of the geometric variables confined to the rotor height 2H, the rotor radius R, the number of rotor blades N, and the airfoil C. The results obtained are displayed as rotor power coefficient curves as a function of blade tip speed ratio. As it resulted in the ideal range for the angle of the blade between 45° and 65°, according to the rotor in this range, the value of maximum power coefficient CpMAX is at its maximum and the range of tip speed ratios is the highest in addition to the diminution of the problem of self-movement. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The dynamic stall phenomenon is characterized by the formation of a leading-edge vortex, which is responsible for adverse aerodynamic forces and moments adversely impacting the structural strength and life of a system. Aerodynamic shape optimization (ASO) provides a cost-effective approach to delay or mitigate the dynamic stall characteristics. Unfortunately, ASO requires multiple evaluations of accurate but time-consuming computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations to produce optimum designs rendering the optimization process computationally costly. The current work proposes a surrogate-based optimization (SBO) technique to alleviate the computational burden of ASO to delay and mitigate the deep dynamic stall characteristics of airfoils. In particular, the Kriging regression surrogate model is used for approximating the objective and constraint functions. The airfoil geometry is parametrized using six PARSEC parameters. The objective and constraint functions are evaluated with the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations with a C-grid mesh topology and Menter's shear stress transport turbulence model. The approach is demonstrated on a vertical axis wind turbine airfoil at a Reynolds number of 135,000 and a Mach number of 0.1 undergoing a sinusoidal oscillation with a reduced frequency of 0.05. The surrogate model is constructed with 60 initial samples and further refined with 20 infill samples using expected improvement. The generated surrogate model is validated with the normalized root mean square error based on 20 test data samples. The refined surrogate model is utilized for finding the optimal design using multi-start gradient-based search. The optimal airfoil has a higher thickness, larger leading-edge radius, and an aft camber compared to the baseline. These geometric shape changes delay the dynamic stall angle by over 3∘ and reduces the severity of the pitching moment coefficient fluctuation. Finally, global sensitivity analysis is conducted on the optimal design using Sobol' indices revealing the most influential shape variables and their interaction effects impacting the airfoil dynamic stall characteristics. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The continuous and the binary techniques are the main types of genetic algorithms that could be employed for an optimization problem. The study investigates the robustness and accuracy of each technique for the wind turbine blades design and optimization problem. For that purpose, the geometry of the blade was designed for the maximization of the output power, the desirable goal of the blade design. The design variables consist of the distribution of the chord and twist along the blade. Results indicate that the continuous genetic algorithm outperforms the binary one from the standpoint of the accuracy and also the computational time. However, the use of uniform crossover could improve the convergence rate of the binary genetic algorithm. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis of the applied genetic algorithms with respect to the population size and the mutation rate was performed to find the appropriate values for those parameters. The outcomes emphasized that adopting a small number of population size together with a large number of generations could speed up the convergence rate of the problem. Also approved in the study was the efficiency of the so-called “Superblade” operator which improved the convergence rate of the algorithm and resulted in the powerful blades. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The construction cost of hybrid wind turbine tower is one of the most important factors for structural design. In this paper, an optimization method based on the particle swarm optimization algorithm and finite element method, was proposed to minimize the cost by optimizing the segments and geometry of hybrid towers. The tower construction cost of towers of 2.5 MW wind turbine is taken as the optimal function, and the constraint conditions include strength, stiffness, stability, fatigue, overhead deformation and nature frequency. The results show that the most unfavorable combination of action effects should be the state where the first variable load is horizontal aerodynamic force in the condition of cut-out wind speed. The thickness of steel segment has the most important effect on construction cost, and the second is the height and thickness of concrete segment. Besides, the cost is lowest when the height of concrete segment occupies around 75% of the total height. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With the 2010/31/EU directive, all new buildings shall be nearly zero-energy buildings (nZEB) from 2020 onward, with the aim of strongly reducing the energy consumption related to the building sector. To achieve this goal, it is not sufficient to focus on the design of the building envelope; smart and efficient energy management is necessary. Moreover, to ensure the adoption of RES systems in the built environment, innovative technologies need to be further developed in order to increase their cost-effectiveness, energy efficiency and integration capability. This paper proposes a synthesis, design and operation optimization of an integrated multi-energy system composed of traditional and innovative renewable technologies, developed within the European project ReCOGNITION. A biogas-based micro cogeneration unit, lightweight glass-free photovoltaic modules, a passive variable geometry small wind turbine optimized for an urban environment and latent heat thermal storage based on phase change materials are some of the technologies developed within the Re-COGNITION project. The optimization problem is solved to contemporarily evaluate (a) the optimal design and (b) the optimal operations of the set of technologies considering both investment and operating costs, using mixed integer non-linear programming. The optimization is applied to the four pilots that are developed during the project, in various European cities (Turin (Italy), Corby (United Kingdom), Thessaloniki (Greece), Cluj-Napoca (Romania). Simulation results show that the development and optimal exploitation of new technologies through optimization strategies provide significant benefits in terms of cost (between 11% and 42%) and emissions (between 10% and 25%), managing building import/export energy and charge/discharge storage cycles. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The application of Savonius wind rotor is increasing worldwide to provide electricity without contributing to global warming and promoting the small-scale power production. However, its lower performance remains a major problem due to high unproductive torque produced by the returning blade. In this paper, an optimum blade profile is obtained by maximizing the power coefficient (CP) considering the overlap ratio (OR) as an optimization parameter. This is done by coupling computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation to the rotor blade profile developed through the simplex search method. The blade profile is symmetric about the x-axis, where half of the blade geometry is formed by a natural cubic spline curve using three points. Two end points are retained fixed, while x and y of the third point is taken as a variable in addition to OR in the simplex search process throughout its iteration using the MATLAB platform. In all the iterations, the blade profile is meshed by using ANSYS ICEM CFD platform. The rotor performance analysis is carried out by ANSYS Fluent using the shear-stress transport (SST) k-ω turbulence model. The finite volume method (FVM) is used as a solver setup to solve the transient 2D flow around the rotor blade. The optimum blade profile is compared to a conventional semicircular blade profile over a wide range of tip speed ratio (TSR). The present study demonstrates the superior performance of the optimum blade profile showing CPmax that is 23% higher than the conventional semicircular blade profile at TSR = 0.8. Further, at OR = 0.154, the CP is found to be maximum. The velocity magnitude contours, total pressure and turbulence intensity contours are generated to analyse the effect of the optimal design approach. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study aims to optimize and investigate small horizontal-axis wind turbine blades at low wind speeds. The objective of this study is to explain the design method based on BEM theory for 0.2 m blade rotors with constant, variable, and linear chord with twisted blade geometry. MATLAB and Xfoil programs were used to apply BEM principles on wind turbines with SG6043 airfoil. Numerical and experimental studies were carried out to examine the impact of rotor solidity values from 0.057 to 0.207 and the number of blades from 3 to 7. The experimental blades were developed using a 3D printing additive manufacturing technique. The rotors were investigated in an open wind tunnel at wind speeds ranging from 2 to 8 m/s. The initial investigation range included tip speed ratios from 2 to 8 and angles of attacks from 2° to 20°. Subsequently, these parameters were varied in Matlab and Xfoil software to optimization and investigate the power coefficient, blade geometry, number of blades, and blade pitch angle. It was found that a rotor solidity of 0.055–0.085 displayed better performance. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - A three-dimensional heat conduction model of wind turbine blade with defect is established based on equivalent source theory, which solves the problem that one-dimensional heat conduction model cannot effectively predict the three-dimensional heat flow around the anisotropic material defect, and the accurate evaluation of the defect depth of the large-scale wind turbine blade is realized with pulsed infrared thermal imaging technology. The three-dimensional heat conduction equation of the blade with defect is simplified to isotropic problem with linear coordinate transformation, and then the analytical solution of the surface excess temperature in the defect area under the third boundary condition is obtained using separating variable method. Finally, the quantitative relationship among geometry dimensions of the defect, the peak time of excess temperature and the depth of defect is established. The on-site detection of 1.5 MW wind turbine blade made of GFRP composite material was carried out, which proves the feasibility of the proposed method, and the detection results show that the detection range reaches 7.8 mm, the detection error is less than 10%, and the detection accuracy is improved by 10%~31.4% compared with the one-dimensional model method. In addition, when the defect depth exceeds 3 mm, the boundary heat transfer cannot be ignored, otherwise more than 10.0% detection error will be caused. The method proposed in this paper can provide a reference for the defect detection of other anisotropic materials. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Rotor systems play a vital role in processing machinery, aero engines, and wind turbines. Since moving parts can be worn during operation, the system performance is variable throughout the service period actually, especially for the rotor system with various defects. Unfortunately, the existing models about bearing defects are established neglecting the changes of dynamic behaviors, which may not reflect the practice well. Thus, a model that considers this variation is proposed in this paper. The effects of both distributed and localized defects are modeled under the excitation from the system itself. Based on the Lankarani-Nikaravesh model and experimental observations, we established a time-varying wear model. The influences are considered not only on system dynamic behaviors but also on the geometry topographies of both parts and defects. The proposed model is validated with experimental data and prior researches. Extensive case studies are carried out to investigate the influences of the defects on system performance under an imbalanced excitation. The comparison performances of diverse systems at different times are conducted to illustrate the effects of the wear on systems responses. This model provides a better understanding for the performance evolution of rotor systems during the service period. Additionally, this model is also applicable for system fault diagnosis and health monitoring. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The paper proposes an adaptation of mathematical models derived from the theory of deterministic chaos to short-term power forecasts of wind turbines. The operation of wind power plants and the generated power depend mainly on the wind speed at a given location. It is a stochastic process dependent on many factors and very difficult to predict. Classical forecasting models are often unable to find the existing relationships between the factors influencing wind power output. Therefore, we decided to refer to fractal geometry. Two models based on selfsimilar processes (M-CO) and (M-COP) and the (M-HUR) model were built. The accuracy of these models was compared with other short-term forecasting models. The modified model of power curve adjusted to local conditions (M-PC) and Canonical Distribution of the Vector of Random Variables Model (CDVRM). Examples of applications confirm the valuable properties of the proposed approaches. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The balance between production and consumption is a major problem for the electricity transmission system operator. Any variation must be compensated by to produce or absorb active and reactive power. This paper presents a linear quadratic regulator with integrateur (LQI) and exact linearization feedback (ELF) controller for a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) in order to track the reference of the active and reactive power. The ELF controller maintains the original model that is nonlinear and with the aid of the differential geometry, the model is linearized and the LQI considers the model of the DFIG is linear with terms of disturbances. The goal is to determine which controller gives acceptable results and requires less measurement sensors. Matlab/Simulink simulate the dynamic behavior of the DFIG under variable wind speed. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In this work, a methodology for the shape and sizing optimization of steel jackets for offshore wind turbines considering the full dynamic response of the structure in a fully-coupled model is presented. The coupled model includes the jacket, the transition piece, the tower of the turbine, the rotor-nacelle assembly and the blades. The rotation of the blades is also included in the model. Ultimate limit state (ULS), fatigue limit state (FLS) and natural frequency constraints are imposed to the model and the weight of the steel jacket is optimized using design variables that control the size of the elements and the overall geometry of the structure. A new formulation is introduced to deal with time-dependent ULS constraints allowing an efficient treatment of the constraints while being suitable for gradientbased optimization. The formulation reduces the size of the large-scale constrained optimization problem and the constraints are satisfied at every time-step of the dynamic analysis. This work represents the first optimization approach to tackle the optimization of the jackets in fully-coupled models with constraints in the complete dynamic response and in the fatigue damage. A numerical example is shown and optimized achieving a significant reduction of half of the weight of the structure and a considerable change in the overall geometry of the structure. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this work is to present a precise numerical calculus method capable to predict the behavior of a wind turbine mast, which is characterized by an open door in its lower part in order to facilitate the access to maintenance tasks. A parametric study had been conducted in this context. The structure studied of steel tower is considered a thin cylindrical shell with constant section and thickness along its studied height. The geometry of the tower had been modeled by non-linear shell type elements. Designers use interior reinforcements to avoid local buckling and minimize the disturbance of the distribution of stress in extreme conditions. The designs adopted in the models are proposed to achieve optimized results, the minimization of the mass, the maximization of the natural frequency and the rigidity at the end of the work. Many configuration had been considered in this study, the enhancement of the gap by using a panel with variable thickness value, by longitudinal stiffeners, by combined stiffeners and finally by a stiffened panel. A numerical model had been suggested to examine a cylindrical shell behavior in compression using the Abaqus software. The obtained results demonstrate the viability and performance of the proposed approach which perfectly meets the structural requirements of the wind tower. We have observed that the stiff plate model gives reliable results to stability under extreme load. On the other hand it is economically profitable is less material needed for manufacturing, which reduces the cost. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The design constraints including capture area and mode transition point of turbine-based combined cycle (TBCC) inlet are determined by the performance analysis of combined cycle propulsion system. According to the mass flow and thrust requirement of the combined cycle engine, the capture area of 1.0 m2 and mode transition between Ma 2.2 and 2.5 are recommended. Based on these two quantities an over/under TBCC inlet which can operate from takeoff to Ma 4.0 is designed. The variable geometry scheme of TBCC inlet is shown at different flight Mach number. Three dimensional numerical simulations of full-scale model and wind tunnel test of 8-percent scale model are explored to verify this inlet design method. The results from the numerical simulations and experimental tests indicate that the TBCC inlet could work properly during this Mach number range. The mass flow captured by the inlet and total pressure recovery at turbine/ramjet aerodynamic interface planes (AIP) meet the requirement of the TBCC propulsion system. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The required reliability of wind turbine gearboxes increases the requirements for large gear measurements. Extensive measurements to reliably assess the geometry of large gears in the single micrometer range are necessary. Due to an individually fixed measuring volume, standard methods like coordinate and gear measuring instruments reach their limits for large gears with diameters >1 m. Therefore, a scalable optical measurement approach consisting of a single sensor in combination with a rotary table for multi-distance measurements with subsequent model-based evaluation of shape parameters of gears is presented. The scalable measurement approach is to be extended to a multisensory system in further work. As a fundamental shape parameter the mean base circle radius using the example of spur gears is determined. The base circle radius is used due to the geometric relationship to further shape parameters for example to the profile slope deviation. The theoretically achievable measurement uncertainty of the mean base circle radius due to sensor noise is estimated to less than 5 μm (k = 2) for a small and a large gear, which verifies the scalability of the sensor system. In order to show a general proof of principle, two series of optical measurements on a gear with a diameter of 0.105m are performed and referenced with a tactile measurement. As a result, random errors of 1.2 μm for k = 2 are determined. The remaining systematic deviations to the reference value amount to 4.3 and 1.6 μm, respectively. Hence, the total measurement uncertainty is currently limited by systematic effects, and the defined aim of a total uncertainty of less than 5 μm (k = 2) is narrowly missed by 1.5 μm. The random errors of 1.2 μm (k = 2) show, however, that an adequate measurement precision is achieved and that the multi-distance measurement approach has the potential to reach the aimed measurement uncertainty with appropriate strategies to compensate for the systematic influences. The experimental and theoretical results prove the principle applicability of the proposed single sensor multi-distance approach for the precise inspection of gears. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Drones arc a growing business in Europe, delivering services in all environments, including urban areas: Delivery of goods and e-commerce, precision agriculture, mapping, infrastructure inspections. In order to allow the integration of this platform in urban areas and to obtain public acceptance, it is necessary to significantly reduce the noise produced by the propellers. Currently, the level of noise generated by propellers is too relevant in terms of annoying effects induccd on living beings. In particular, low altitude flights have been found to disturb citizens and frighten animals. With the aim to tackle such an issue, this paper describes an experimental parametric analysis of a passive noise control technique to reduce the signature generated by small-scale propeller employed for mini unmanned aerial propulsion. The noise control strategy here proposed is based on a serration pattern realized at the trailing edge (TE) of the blade. Despite the same approach has already been successfully employed to mitigate noise generated by wind turbines and fixed wing aircraft, few studies have been devoted to investigate the effects of a serration pattern on small propellers. A large number of different serration were realized by varying height, width and teeth distribution. The idea is to find the optimal serration geometry in terms of acoustic requirements and to highlight the role of teeth number. Results shows a sensible reduction in the noise propeller signature. Serration effects seems to depend strongly from the polar angle identifying different region of operation. Spectral Analysis points out that the serration affect the low frequency region and even the tonal component of aerodynamic noise. Statistical analysis shows a departure from a Gaussian distribution and an effect of damping on distribution tails. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Savonius wind turbines are characterized by various advantages such as simple design, independence of wind direction, and low noise emission, but they suffer from low efficiency. Numerous investigations were carried out to face this problem. In the present paper, a new idea of the Savonius turbine with a variable geometry of blades is proposed. Its blades, made of elastic material, were continuously deformed during the rotor revolution to increase a positive torque of the advancing blade and to decrease a negative torque of the returning blade. In order to assess the turbine aerodynamic performance, a two-dimensional numerical model was developed. The fluid-structure interaction (FSI) method was applied where blade deformations were defined by computational solid mechanics (CSM) simulations, whereas computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations allowed for transient flow prediction. The influence of the deformation magnitude and the position of maximally deformed blades with respect to the incoming wind direction were studied. The aerodynamic performance increased with an increase in the deformation magnitude. The power coefficient exceeded Cp = 0.30 for the eccentricity magnitude of 10% and reached 0.39 for the highest magnitude under study. It corresponded to 90% improvement in comparison to Cp = 0.21 in the case of the fixed-shape Savonius turbine. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper, an optimal semisubmersible platform is sought considering two key geometry variables: The diameter of the outer cylinders and their radial distance from the platform centre. The goal is to identify a platform configuration able to most efficiently contrast the combined windwave action, keeping the platform dimensions as small as possible. The amplitude of the Response Amplitude Operator (RAO) peaks and the integral area of the RAOs in a range of excited frequencies for the selected degrees of freedom are chosen as targets to be minimised. Through an efficient frequency domain simulation approach, we show that upscaling techniques proposed in the literature may lead to overdesigned platforms and that smaller and more performing platforms can be identified. In particular, the optimised platform shows a reduction of about 51% in parked and 54% in power production of the heave RAO peak, and a reduction of about 37% in parked and 50% in power production of the pitch RAO. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The present investigation used numerical simulations to study the vortex induced vibrations (VIVs) of a 96 m long wind turbine blade. The results of this baseline shape were compared with four additional geometry variants featuring different tip extensions. The geometry of the tip extensions was generated through the variation of two design parameters: the dihedral angle bending the blade out of the rotor plane and the sweep angle bending the blade in the rotor plane. The applied numerical methods relied on a fluid structure interaction (FSI) approach, coupling a computational fluid dynamics solver with a multi-body structural solver. The methodology followed for locating VIV regions was based on the variation of the inclination angle. This variable was defined as the angle between the freestream velocity and the blade axis, being 0° when these vectors were normal and positive when a velocity component from tip to root was introduced. For the baseline geometry, the FSI simulations predicted significant blade vibrations for inclination angles between 47.5° and 60° with a maximum peak-to-peak amplitude of 2.3 m. The installation of the different tip extensions on the blade geometry was found to significantly modify the inclination angles where VIV was observed. In particular, the simulations of three of the tip designs showed a shifting of several degrees for the point where the maximum vibrations were recorded. For the specific tip geometry where only the sweep angle was taken into account, a total mitigation of the VIV was observed. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - One of possible trends in the development of wind-power engineering consists in implementation of double-fed electric machine as a main power generator. This type of electric machines is well-known, however, their application in wind power plants appears to be a new engineering solution. Having a strong influence on generator design and its operational mode, special working conditions of wind power plants require a new approach to the engineering design, in particular to the design of generators to be applied in the above-mentioned field. The present article contains one of optimal engineering techniques that is based on mathematical modeling and is used to design double-fed generators for wind-power plants application. On the one hand, the mathematical model should be simple to be easily included into variety of programmed cycles in order to determine optimum dimensions. On the other hand, the mathematical model should be able to provide required accuracy of the main parameters and characteristics. Such mathematical model is described in the present article. Its basis is generalized variables with transparent physical significance, short variation range and fixed boundaries. The optimization algorithm uses Gauss-Seidel method coordinate descent approach to achieve optimum and Fibonacci method to select step. The structure of the mathematical model is provided in the article. The accuracy of the elaborated model was verified using CAD software of Ansys Electronics Desktop and later this model served as a basis for designing 3MW generator, as well as proved to have good convergence with test results. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This article proposes a method to correct the numerical near singularity stress field in vicinity of reentrant corners by a semi-analytical solution. The approach pertains to perfectly bonded bi-material interface V-notches with arbitrary opening angles under Mode-III loading. The method addresses dissimilar joints with sharp corners in large-scale numerical engineering models where high-resolution discretization becomes computationally expensive. The method is therefore particularly useful for fatigue lifetime analysis of shear-bending dominated large utility multi material structures such as compound castings, aircraft wings and wind turbine rotor blades to name a few. The solution for the governing Laplace equation is obtained by separation of variables in conjunction with the eigenvalue expansion method yielding the bi-material notch singularity exponent. The notch stress intensity factor is then used to fit the analytical singular near field to the numerical far field utilizing the fact that the latter is more accurately predicted. The analytical anti-plane shear stress correction method is valid for any geometry subject to arbitrary remote loading conditions. The accuracy of the approach is investigated by numerical stress analysis of a slender beam subject to axial torsion for different notch opening angles. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The aerodynamic performance of horizontal-axis wind turbines is strongly dependent on many parameters, among which the airfoil type and the blade geometry (mainly defined by the chord and the twist distributions) are considered the most critical ones. In this article, an approach giving the appropriate airfoil for a small wind turbine design was conducted by performing an aerodynamic improvement of the blade’s airfoil. First, a preliminary design of the rotor blades of a small wind turbine (11 kW) was conducted using the small wind turbine rotor design code. This preliminary approach was done for different airfoils, and it resulted in a maximum power coefficient of 0.40. Then, the aerodynamic efficiency of the wind turbine was improved by modifying the geometry of the airfoils. This technique targets the optimization of the lift-to-drag ratio (Cl/Cd) of the airfoil within a range of angles of attack. Also, a non-uniform rational B-spline approximation of the airfoil was adopted in order to reduce the number of the design variables of the optimization. This methodology determined the best airfoil for the design of a small wind turbine, and it gave an improved power coefficient of 0.42. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

The turbine is a novel hybrid Savonius-Darrieus combined rotor which aims optimizing performances in medium-low wind regimes, by using a careful design of the shape, size and relative positions of Savonius and Darrieus blades. To this end, a dynamically scaled turbine model is tested in wind tunnel to derive instantaneous and averaged velocity fields by means of Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), which allows deriving wakes and specific fluid flow phenomena on each single configuration (Savonius or Darrieus) and interactions on the combined geometry. These results are coupled with electrical measurements to determine global performances, efficiency and best working conditions for each separate turbine and for the combined turbine. Data are also compared with results obtained by other authors in previously reported combined hybrid configurations. The proposed system is able to work with good performances (power coefficient equal or slightly lower than 0.2), on an extended range of operative conditions, covering those of each component alone, i.e. for tip speed ratios between 0.5 and 4, in comparison to the ranges 0.5 ÷ 1 and 1.7 ÷ 4 of the used Savonius and Darrieus components. Motivations for the increased performances and working ranges reached by the proposed combined turbine, especially in the low tip speed ratio regime, are given as derived from detailed PIV velocity measurements. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Based on the control variable method and orthogonal test method，the performance of the rubber sealing ring for the steel pile plug of offshore wind turbine was analyzed by finite element method. The influence of material hardness，friction coefficient of contact surface，compression ratio，contact surface ovality and the geometry parameters of the seal cross-section on the performance of the rubber sealing ring was studied. The results showed that the increase of material hardness and compression ratio of the rubber sealing ring would improve its sealing performance，but at the same time，they would also have a negative impact. The increase of contact surface friction coefficient had no significant effect on the sealing performance of the rubber sealing ring. The effect of the geometry parameters of the seal cross-section on the working performance of the rubber sealing ring decreased in the order of section width，contact surface ovality and section length. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - An experimental investigation of the effect of inlet flow conditions and improved geometries on the performance of modern axial exhaust diffusers of gas turbines has been completed. As the first of a two-part series, this article concentrates on characterizing diffuser sensitivity to parametric variations in internal geometry and inlet flow conditions. Full-factorial experiments were carried out on five parameters including the inlet Mach distribution, shape of the support struts, shape of the oil-drain strut, diffuser hade angle, and the hubcap configuration. To enable an efficient sweep of the design space, experiments were performed in this initial study at a down-scaled turbine exit Reynolds number (Re<inf>H</inf> roughly 3% of the value for an H-class diffuser) and at a full-scale turbine exit Mach number. The study was accomplished in a continuous, cold-flow wind tunnel circuit, and tailored distributions of Mach number, swirl velocity, and radial velocity derived from on-design conditions of an industry diffuser were generated. Measurements included 5-hole probe traverses at planes of interest. Diffuser performance was most sensitive to the inlet Mach distribution with losses of 0.081 points of pressure recovery due to a nonuniform Mach distribution with higher velocity near the hub versus a uniform one. Detailed comparisons of axial flow variation for a top-performing configuration versus related configurations shed physical insight regarding the evolution of kinetic energy distortion into viscous loss in the wake, as well as highlight the benefit of uniform inlet profiles in practice despite the lower theoretical recovery of such cases. The results presented here isolate the inlet flow distribution as a parameter of high interest for further study which is carried out for both on- and off-design conditions in the companion article [1]. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Wind Turbine blades are constantly exposed to extremely adverse environmental conditions throughout their operation. As a result, they inevitably suffer damage from erosion, exposure as well as more acute incidents such as lightning strikes and extreme wind speeds. Damage must be repaired in the shortest possible time frame to reduce blade downtime. However, current repair processes are highly variable and not optimized for the unique geometry of each repair or environmental conditions. The goal of this study is to optimize the cure cycle to produce a homogeneously cured repair patch in the shortest time and to identify key cure cycle parameters, such as heating rate, cure temperature, hold time, etc., that significantly affect the time and quality of the repair. The effect of each cure cycle parameter on the repair time is investigated individually within a combined experimental-numerical framework. Extensive material characterization of the neat resin is conducted. First, the resin and the curing agent are separately exposed to environmental conditions to measure the moisture absorption capacity. Then, the curing behavior of the resin is characterized using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) as a function of different environmental conditions. Lastly, Finite element (FE) curing simulations of a single-side scarf repair, are performed within Abaqus through user-written subroutines, to investigate the effect of cure cycle parameters and environmental conditions on the blade repair time. The effect of each parameter is quantified in terms of peak exothermic temperature, spatial distribution of cure and temperature within the repair and the total repair time. Experimental validation in lab conditions is proposed to validate the FE and to gauge the quality of the repair resulting from the optimized cure cycle. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper provides explanations and analysis of how the power coefficient (Cp) of the Parabolic wind rotor has been affected by changing its geometrical design parameters. The results were presented in the form of (Cp) curves as a function of tip speed ratio (λ0). The aerodynamic mathematical mode called "multi-streamtube" was implemented. To determine the Cp(λ0) of the Parabolic rotor, regardless of its engineering shape, a computer program has been prepared by using Microsoft Visual Basic. The geometrical design parameters covered in this study are rotor blades number (N), rotor height (h) or (2H), rotor diameter (2R) and chord line (C). Whereas, through these parameters a total of 57 configurations were utilized and adopted. Thus, this number of different designs was sufficient to identify the performance behaviors of the Parabolic wind rotor. Accordingly, the results indicated that increasing rotor height to diameter ratio (H/R) leads to a decrease in Cp over low tip speed ratio range for all values of solidity, σ, (NC/R) investigated. However, higher values of (H/R) result in a raise in Cp over high tip speed ratio range for values of (NC/R) less than 0.2 approximately. Thus, it seems that higher (H/R) values constitute an advantage for fast rotating rotors (low (NC/R) and high tip speed ratio). © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Monopod bucket foundation is a promising foundation concept which was developed in the last decade to be used as the supporting structures for offshore wind turbines. In this study, a three-dimensional finite element modeling was used to evaluate ultimate horizontal load and moment capacities of monopod and tripod bucket foundations. Various foundation geometries installed in dense sandy soil were considered to obtain load-displacement and moment rotation curves. A comparison between the horizontal load and moment capacities of monopod and tripod bucket foundations was performed. Dimensionless variables for these foundation types were presented. The results show that the loading conditions and foundation geometries affect on the ultimate load and moment capacities. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This work presents a novel self-regulated toroidal continuously variable transmission (ART-CVT) that features a passive control of the speed ratio, achieved with no need for supplementary actuation system. The proposed transmission system is based on a full-toroidal CVT topology which combines a specially shaped geometry of the conjugate profiles with a pre-load system to create a correlation between the speed ratio and the input torque. Such a solution is conceived to reduce the complexity that is usually associated with active regulated systems and it is envisaged to be applicable to low-power/low-cost systems such as small wind turbines, powered-two-wheelers, or bicycles. We illustrate a simplified mathematical model that is able to describe the response of the proposed ART-CVT in quasi-static steady-state operational conditions. Additionally, we propose a case-study in a realistic scenario: a design for an ART-CVT that matches the requirements of a low-power wind turbine coupled with a synchronous generator directly connected to the grid without additional power converters. The achieved results show that an ART-CVT is able to reach working conditions close to the maximum theoretical aerodynamic performance without any active regulation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The possibilities of stabilizing the rotor speed of a vertical-axial wind power plant as, which can be included as an element in a complex power plant, which is a cyber-physical system (CPS), for additional and emergency power supply of surface robotic complexes are considered. For this purpose, it is proposed to use the method of stabilizing the angular velocity by controlling the position of the moving structural element of the installation in question. Received the corresponding law of regulation of the angular velocity of rotation of the rotor. The equations of the system for stabilizing the rotor rotation frequency with aperiodic wind disturbance are simulated. It is shown that the constructed regulator is able to effectively counter the influence of wind disturbances. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Due to the harsh working environments, variable speeds and alternating loads, wind turbines are likely to breakdown or suffer damage. Effective condition monitoring methods for wind turbines are essential for maintenance decisions which aim to reduce O&M costs. A typical supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system records comprehensive wind turbine condition parameters, which would be fault informative. Thus, a framework for condition monitoring of wind turbines is introduced based on adaptive control charts and SCADA data. The adaptive exponential weighted moving average (AEWMA) is proposed for abnormal state alarm of wind turbines. Random forest (RF) is used for feature selection and regression prediction to establish the normal condition prediction model (NCPM) of wind turbine with fault-free SCADA data. The performance and robustness of various control charts are compared comprehensively. Compared with the exponential weighted moving average (EWMA) control charts, the AEWMA control chart behaves more sensitive to the abnormal state, and thus has more effective anomaly identification ability and better robustness. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In this work, a 370-W small wind turbine was developed which is equipped to a controllable nuzzle-diffuser duct. The developed duct is consisting of a fixed ring and a two-piece diffuser which can rotate on each other and so the diffuser wall opening will have altered from 0 to 180°. This mechanism is developed to control speed-up ratio and drag forces acting on the turbine structure in high ranges of wind speeds. The rotor is designed using BEM algorithm and the duct geometry is reached by CFD works considering the atheistic aspect of view. As the turbine is designed for a comprehensive research project, so it contains several asubsystems like an electromagnetic brake, external electric starter motor, electromagnetic flywheel, variable nacelle, etc. The designed mechanism fabricated using several machining processes as turning, milling, boring, drilling, welding and rolling works. The turbine performance implemented in a low-speed wind tunnel. Experimental results show a comprehensive raise in power generation and rotor speed by shrouded wind turbines. In the 180-degree diffuser wall opening, the augmentation ratio in average is 39.75% while the ratio is 28.5% for a complete diffuser augmented wind turbine. The rotor speed-up ratio for them is 53 and 74% respectively. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
