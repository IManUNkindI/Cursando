This study introduces dynamic design modifications to tackle this challenge, including optimal selection of initial blade profiles, adjustments to the diameter and rotational speed of the internal Savonius rotor. A two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model, validated against experimental data, assesses these design changes. Shifting the internal rotor blade shape from semicircular to elliptical does not improve performance; however, altering the NACA profile to thinner aerofoils significantly enhances efficiency by 12 % at high TSRs. The collapsed rotor design enhances performance by 5–7 % for TSRs above 2.3 due to reduced vortex shedding. Among all the modifications considered, reducing the internal rotor velocity proves the most effective, achieving a peak power coefficient of 0.3354, surpassing that of Darrieus turbine. This study thoroughly analyses variations in torque and pressure coefficients resulting from these changes. It concludes by proposing a novel dynamic design integrating blade shape thickness morphing with reduced internal rotor velocity, thus contributing to sustainable development by optimizing turbine performance across different TSRs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Collapsed Rotor; Dynamic Design; Hybrid Turbine; Power Coefficient; Reduced Internal Rotor Velocity; Savonius-darrieus Turbine; Tip Speed Ratio; Starting; Turbine Components; Turbomachine Blades; Collapsed Rotor; Darrieus Turbine; Dynamic Design; Hybrid Turbine; Internal-rotor; Power Coefficients; Reduced Internal Rotor Velocity; Rotor Velocity; Savonii-darrieus Turbine; Tip Speed Ratio; Efficiency; Computational Fluid Dynamics; Energy Efficiency; Numerical Model; Turbine; Vortex Flow","Starting; Turbine components; Turbomachine blades; Collapsed rotor; Darrieus turbine; Dynamic design; Hybrid turbine; Internal-rotor; Power coefficients; Reduced internal rotor velocity; Rotor velocity; Savonii-darrieus turbine; Tip speed ratio; Efficiency; computational fluid dynamics; energy efficiency; numerical model; turbine; vortex flow","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008639371"

This approach entails the replacement of the conventional SWT's concave surface with a series of small blades, distributed in both convex and concave positions, arranged in an undulating pattern along the surface. Four models have been tested (MODEL22, MODEL30, MODEL60 and MODEL80) in an attempt to verify the effectiveness of this new method in enhancing wind turbine power coefficient. We use ANSYS Fluent software to solve the Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) and the SST k-omega turbulence model equations.

The primary objective is to delay flow separation on the convex side of the advancing blade at specific azimuthal angles during rotation. Flow separation in this region, caused by adverse pressure gradients, typically limits the effective area for lift generation, reducing torque and efficiency. By implementing suction cavities that extract air from the blade surface, the flow remains attached further toward the blade root, thereby widening the surface area over which lift is generated. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The rotor with suction cavities (optimized case) demonstrated a significant improvement in the coefficient of power (C<inf>P</inf>) compared to the base rotor performance. The optimized case achieved a Cp of 0.546 at a tip-speed ratio (TSR) of 0.9 and reached a peak C<inf>P</inf> of 0.622 at TSR = 1.01, exceeding the theoretical Betz limit due to the introduction of external energy through an active flow control. Analysis of pressure and velocity contours revealed that the suction cavities create a low-pressure region along the convex surface, enhance flow attachment, and increase lift forces and torque generation. The findings indicate that the use of suction cavities as an active flow control mechanism is effective in enhancing the efficiency of Savonius turbines. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Active Flow Control; Cavity; Cfd Simulation; Savonius Turbine; Suction Cavities; Flow Separation; Lift; Turbine Components; Turbomachine Blades; Wind Turbines; Active Flow Control; Cavity; Coefficient Of Power; Computational Fluid Dynamics Simulations; Flow Control Methods; Savonius Turbine; Savonius Wind Turbine; Suction Cavity; Tip Speed Ratio; Turbine Efficiency; Computational Fluid Dynamics; Flow Control; Cavity; Computational Fluid Dynamics; Flow Control; Suction; Surface Area; Torque; Turbine","Flow separation; Lift; Turbine components; Turbomachine blades; Wind turbines; Active flow control; Cavity; Coefficient of power; Computational fluid dynamics simulations; Flow control methods; Savonius turbine; Savonius wind turbine; Suction cavity; Tip speed ratio; Turbine efficiency; Computational fluid dynamics; Flow control; cavity; computational fluid dynamics; flow control; suction; surface area; torque; turbine","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009307112"

Novel blade shapes are assessed to determine their impact on torque generation, power output, and key performance indicators such as velocity and pressure distributions. Three configurations are proposed, including modifications at the blade ends, modifications near the rotor center, and combined modifications at both the ends and the center. The results demonstrate that optimizing blade geometry can significantly enhance torque generation and power output, leading to improved energy capture.

The Savonius rotor is known to be an inexpensive energy harvesting device. The waves in the NWT were generated using a piston type wave-maker. The results from the computational work were compared with experimental work. For the normal OWC, a maximum power output of 18.85 kW, which corresponds to an efficiency of 22.44% was recorded at 60 rpm for the mean wave condition. On the other hand, for the opposite OWC, the peak power and efficiency were 10.4 kW and 12.38% respectively for the mean sea state. For the novel double OWC, the flow in the front OWC has more energy compared to the flow in the rear OWC for both advancing flow and retreating flow, resulting in a combined peak power of 19.5 kW at the mean sea state.

It presents an innovative approach by integrating vertical-axis wind turbines (VAWTs) with rooftop water storage tanks, using them as structural support. The study aims to enhance the energy output from a cluster of three hybrid Darrieus-Savonius VAWTs by optimizing five key factors: turbine spacing (S<inf>12</inf> and S<inf>13</inf>), configuration angles (ϕ<inf>12</inf> and ϕ<inf>13</inf>), and rotation direction (RD). A three-dimensional, unsteady, and incompressible flow model is developed, which is then numerically solved and validated against previous experimental data. The impact of these variables is assessed using a Taguchi orthogonal array L16 (45). The findings indicate that RD has the greatest influence on total performance, while the distance between the first and second rotors (S<inf>12</inf>) has the least effect. The optimized configuration results in a 26.06% boost in the cluster power coefficient at a shifted tip speed ratio (TSR) of 2.86 compared to the average power coefficient of the isolated rotor (Cpavg of 0.2475) at its rated TSR of 2.64, providing an effective solution for generating electricity in urban areas with restricted space.

However, significant discrepancies exist between two-dimensional (2-D) and three-dimensional (3-D) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, particularly in predicting wake dynamics. This study investigates wake characteristics across varying tip speed ratios (TSRs) using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) of velocity components from 3-D simulations. POD analysis reveals that for TSR ≤ 1.0, vortex shedding from blade tips dominates, whereas for TSR > 1.0, rotational motion becomes more prominent, followed by vortex shedding. The vertical velocity component shows dominant POD modes at the rotational frequency and its harmonics, while the streamwise and lateral components are primarily influenced by the vortex shedding frequencies. These dynamics are absent in 2-D simulations due to the lack of vortex stretching in the third direction, leading to fundamentally different modal structures. Additionally, results show vertical transport is critical to wake recovery, significantly outweighing lateral transport up to two rotor diameters downstream—an effect not captured in 2-D simulations. Since accurate wake modelling is essential for predicting the performance of Savonius turbine arrays, especially in streamwise configurations, the limitations of 2-D simulations pose a challenge. This study provides physical insights into the origins of those limitations and highlights the necessity of 3-D simulations for reliable prediction of array power coefficients.

For that, the suitable turbine is the type of vertical axis wind turbines, and the Darrieus rotor has the highest performance of all VAWTs. It's just that to be able to operate in these conditions, it is necessary to use the Savonius rotor as a starter.

At TSR = 0.87, the maximum power coefficient (C<inf>P</inf>) of 0.2345 is achieved by the blade with a 70° V-Angle and a straight edge length of 0.335 L. Pressure and velocity field analyses reveal that appropriate geometric adjustments can optimize the high-pressure zone on the advancing blade and suppress negative torque on the returning blade, thereby increasing net output. The influence mechanisms of the V-angle and straight-edge length variations on blade performance were further explored and summarized through a comparative analysis of the vorticity characteristics. This study established a detailed performance dataset, providing theoretical and empirical support for V-shaped rotor blade design studies and offering engineering guidance for the effective use of low-flow hydropower. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blade Profile; Coefficient Of Torque; Hydrodynamic Performance; Savonius Hydrokinetic Turbine; V-shaped Turbine Blade; Hydrodynamics; Statistics; Turbine Components; Turbomachine Blades; Two Phase Flow; Blade Profile; Coefficient Of Torques; Edge Length; Hydrodynamics Performance; Hydrokinetic Turbines; Performance; Savonii Hydrokinetic Turbine; Straight Edge; Turbine Blade; V-shaped Turbine Blade; Computational Fluid Dynamics","Hydrodynamics; Statistics; Turbine components; Turbomachine blades; Two phase flow; Blade profile; Coefficient of torques; Edge length; Hydrodynamics performance; Hydrokinetic turbines; Performance; Savonii hydrokinetic turbine; Straight edge; Turbine blade; V-shaped turbine blade; Computational fluid dynamics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105011659592"

The gravitational vortex turbine (GVT) is one of the emerging technologies in the field of renewable energy that has gained attention for its simple and low-cost manufacturing process. The turbine operates by utilizing the energy of wastewater or other liquid flows to generate power on-site, making it a potentially viable solution for small-scale power generation. However, the optimization of the turbine's design is necessary to improve its efficiency and to make it a more competitive source of renewable energy. Previous research on GVT has mainly focused on the chamber's design to improve the formation of the vortex. However, little attention has been paid to the rotor design, which is also a critical parameter affecting the turbine's performance. The current study aimed to investigate the performance of three different rotors for the turbine, including the Savonius, H-Darrieus, and a standard rotor with straight blades, using numerical simulations. The numerical simulations were performed using ANSYS software, with ICEM modules for discretization and CFX for simulation. The results showed that the straight-bladed rotor outperformed the other two rotors, with an increase in efficiency of 40% and 79% compared to the Savonius and H-Darrieus geometry blades, respectively. The study highlights the importance of considering the rotor design in the optimization of the gravitational vortex turbine. The results provide valuable insights into the design parameters that can be used to enhance the turbine's performance. These findings can contribute to the development of more efficient and cost-effective gravitational vortex turbines for on-site power generation and consumption. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ansys; Blades; Cfd; Energy; H-darrieus; Icem; Performance; Runner; Savonius; Vortex","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85211460525"

Because of its cheaper cost and independence from wind direction, the Savonius vertical axis wind rotor has the advantage of being suitable for certain implementations as an energy converter. Several studies have been carried out to increase its efficiency from this angle. This research work emphasizes on the Savonius wind rotor numerical model performances.

The flow characteristics of the rotor are studied and analyzed by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) numerical simulation method. The steady and transient performances are studied using SST k-ω model and sliding mesh method, and are compared with that of traditional Savonius rotors. The results show that the average static torque coefficient of the rotor is 0.291, which is higher than the 0.222 of the Savonius rotor.

This study investigates the performance of a hybrid Darrieus–Savonius rotor under various operating conditions. It numerically evaluates the effects of the radius proportion between the Savonius and Darrieus rotors (RP) and the rotor’s mounting angle on power output, using a two-dimensional computational model that simulates unsteady, turbulent, and incompressible flow at different tip-speed ratios (TSRs). The analysis considers three radius proportions (RP) of 0.2, 0.25, and 0.33, along with three mounting angles (θ) of 0°, 45°, and 90°. The numerical results are validated by comparing them with data from existing experimental and numerical studies.

Controlled turbulence was introduced using a turbulence-generating mechanism, with turbulence intensities ranging from 10 % to 14 %. Numerical simulations were performed to validate the experimental results, and the findings revealed that turbulence intensity influenced the aerodynamic efficiency of the turbine blades, enhancing their performance in certain conditions. Notably, under turbulent conditions at lower wind speeds 4 ms-1to 7 ms−1, the torque coefficient increased from 0.24 and 0.15 under uniform flow to 0.40 and 0.44, respectively. At higher wind speeds 8 ms-1and 11 ms−1, a slight decrease in torque coefficient was observed due to the onset of turbulent flow effects. The study advances the understanding of the turbine's performance in turbulent environments, particularly highlighting the importance of turbulence intensity for optimizing turbine design and efficiency in urban and complex wind conditions. These results provide valuable insights for designing wind turbines capable of operating efficiently in varied and dynamic wind environments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Coefficient Of Power; Tip Speed Ratio (λ); Turbulence Intensity; Vawt; Wind Rotor Configuration; Turbine Components; Turbomachine Blades; Turbulent Flow; Vertical Axis Wind Turbine; Coefficient Of Power; Experimental Investigations; Numerical Investigations; Tip Speed Ratio; Tip Speed Ratio (λ); Torque Coefficient; Turbulence Intensity; Vertical Axes Wind Turbines; Wind Rotor; Wind Rotor Configuration; Wind Tunnels","Turbine components; Turbomachine blades; Turbulent flow; Vertical axis wind turbine; Coefficient of power; Experimental investigations; Numerical investigations; Tip speed ratio; Tip speed ratio (λ); Torque coefficient; Turbulence intensity; Vertical axes wind turbines; Wind rotor; Wind rotor configuration; Wind tunnels","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000960592"

Due to the complex nature of the startup dynamics, the published research on it is severely lacking. Unless the startup dynamics and cut-in speed of a wind turbine are known, it is difficult to evaluate its capacity factor and levelized cost of energy (LCoE) for commercial viability. In this study, a Savonius vertical-axis wind turbine (VAWT) has been considered and its startup dynamics evaluated using numerical techniques. Moreover, the effects of turbine inertia, arising from bearing frictional losses, generator load, etc., on the startup dynamics have been studied. Advanced computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-based solvers have been utilized for this purpose. The flow-induced rotation of the turbine blades has been modeled using a six degree of freedom (6DoF) approach. Turbine inertia has been modeled using the mass moment of inertia of the turbine rotor and systematically increased to mimic the additional inertia and losses due to bearings and the generator. The results indicate that inertia has a significant impact on the startup dynamics of the VAWT. It was observed that as the turbine inertia increased, it took longer for the turbine to reach its steady or peak operational speed. Increasing the inertia by 10%, 20% and 30% increased the time taken by the turbine to reach its peak rotational speed by 13.3%, 16.7% and 23.2%, respectively. An interesting observation from the results obtained is that an increase in turbine inertia does not change the peak rotational speed. For the Savonius rotor considered, the peak rotational speed remained 122 rpm, and its tip speed ratio (TSR) remained 0.6 while increasing the turbine inertia. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computational Fluid Dynamics (cfd); Savonius Rotor; Six Degree Of Freedom (6dof); Startup Dynamics; Turbine Inertia; Vertical-axis Wind Turbine (vawt); Bearings (machine Parts); Flow Separation; Turbine Components; Turbomachine Blades; Vertical Axis Wind Turbine; Computational Fluid; Computational Fluid Dynamic; Fluid-dynamics; Savonius Rotor; Six Degree Of Freedom; Six Degrees Of Freedom; Startup Dynamic; Turbine Inertias; Vertical Axes Wind Turbines; Vertical-axis Wind Turbine; Computational Fluid Dynamics","Bearings (machine parts); Flow separation; Turbine components; Turbomachine blades; Vertical axis wind turbine; Computational fluid; Computational fluid dynamic; Fluid-dynamics; Savonius rotor; Six degree of freedom; Six degrees of freedom; Startup dynamic; Turbine inertias; Vertical axes wind turbines; Vertical-axis wind turbine; Computational fluid dynamics","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105002312254"

This study extends previous work by employing overset meshing to improve the design and functionality of controllable flaps, allowing for more realistic hinge placement and rotation. Unlike prior approaches using the sliding mesh technique, each flap is now hinged at the inner tip of its parent rotor blade. This new mechanism allows the flap to rotate inward and vent impinging flows more effectively during the returning sweep, thus reducing negative torques and improving aerodynamic efficiency. Using a Taguchi-based optimization framework and analysis of variance, three flap designs and six operational parameters were systematically analyzed to maximize power output while minimizing energy consumption. The optimal configuration—a mid-half flap design—resulted in a 29% increase in average power coefficient (Cp) at the optimal tip-speed ratio (TSR = 1.0), surpassing previously reported gains of 21% and 25%. Notably, unlike earlier studies where flow venting occurred outward, this study confirms that vented flow is more naturally redirected inward toward the concave side of the returning blades, as initially hypothesized. These findings refine the approach to dynamic venting, demonstrating its potential to reduce negative torques and enhance Savonius rotor efficiency, particularly in practical applications where omnidirectionality and low-speed performance are advantageous. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aerodynamics; Drag; Flaps; Hydraulic Turbines; Potential Flow; Rotors; Turbomachine Blades; Energy Extraction; Hinge Placement; Impinging Flow; Negative Torques; New Mechanisms; Practical Energies; Rotor Blades; Savonius Rotor; Savonius Turbine; Sliding Mesh Technique; Energy Utilization","Aerodynamics; Drag; Flaps; Hydraulic turbines; Potential flow; Rotors; Turbomachine blades; Energy extraction; Hinge placement; Impinging flow; Negative torques; New mechanisms; Practical energies; Rotor blades; Savonius rotor; Savonius turbine; Sliding mesh technique; Energy utilization","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-86000608188"

The purpose of this work is to install Savonius hollow turbines with Darius type wind turbines with vertical axis and straight blades to reduce the weakening of the initial operating capacity of Darius turbines with Straight blades to reduce the weakening of the initial operating capacity of Darius turbines. The novelty and importance of this study is the possibility of using the Darius wind turbine in environments or places with low wind speeds in a more effective way to generate energy. In addition, one of the advantages of VAWTs is that they are simple to manufacture and low in cost. One of the solutions to address the problem of the Darrieus WT, which cannot rotate and does not respond to rotation in the field of low wind speeds, is the use of a combined rotor. In this research paper, the Savonius WT used to increase and improve the efficiency of the 3-Straight Bladed (3-SB) Darrieus WT by combining them together in a way that ensures their rotation on one axis of rotation. A combined Darrieus-Savonius (DS) is a sort of VAWT with numerous points of interest over individual Savonius or individual Darrieus WT, such as superior proficiency and beginning torque than the Darrieus rotor alone. Because of what was mentioned above and in order to solve the Darrieus problem in low wind speed, two models of the WT were designed and manufactured, one of which was a simple Darrieus with 3-SB Darrieus (NACA0012) and the other a combined three blades turbine of the DS, the Darrieus placed above the Savonius rotor. These two models of the WT were tested in a subsonic wind tunnel, the various parameters namely; total power, TSR and power coefficient were calculated. From the present investigation, it is seen that with combined DS wind rotor, the total power and power coefficient start increasing. The maximum power coefficient C<inf>p</inf> of 40% was obtained at a combined WT at a wind velocity of 5 m/s. However, while comparing the power coefficients (C<inf>p</inf> ) for a simple Darrieus-rotor with that of the combined configuration of the DS rotor, it observed that there is a definite improvement in the power coefficient for the combined DS rotor at the same wind velocity. The combined DS rotor provided power of 8.2 watt, which is higher than the power for a simple Darrieus rotor, which is 2.43watt, under the same test conditions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Combined; Naca0012; Power Coefficient; Savonius Wind Turbine; Straight Blade Darrieus Wind Turbine","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-86000039805"

Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the Savonius wind turbine performance with various aspect ratios, number of stages, and twist angles when placed in a low wind speed environment. Wind tunnel experiments were performed to obtain the turbine's static torque coefficient, self-starting wind speed, and power coefficient. A continuous observation of wind speed and the direction of an urban site was performed and analyzed using the Weibull distribution function. The experimental and the site wind assessment data were correlated to evaluate the average power output of each turbine. The result showed that the self-starting wind speed for a conventional Savonius rotor fluctuated due to variations in the rotor's azimuth angle. It was discovered that increasing the number of stages and twist angle, or lowering the aspect ratio, caused a reduction in the starting wind speed magnitudes and fluctuations. Furthermore, the lowest average self-starting wind speed of 2.5 m/s was achieved by a turbine with a 90° twist angle, while the highest power coefficient of 0.201 was produced at 45°.

The performance enhancement of the Savonius multi-stage is contingent upon the phase-shift angle (PSA). The present study employed three-dimensional modeling techniques with Ansys software, specifically utilizing the CFX solver.

One advantageous approach to addressing this problem is the design of a hybrid Darrieus–Savonius VAWT. The hybrid VAWT enhances self-starting capability by increasing the power coefficient ( (Formula presented.) ) within the low tip speed ratio (TSR) range and the torque coefficient ( (Formula presented.) ) at initial azimuth angles, when the blades transition from windward to upwind position. A significant challenge associated with conventional hybrid VAWTs, in which both rotors are mounted on a single shaft, is the decline in efficiency at the high-TSR range. This inefficiency is due to the performance limitations of the inner Savonius rotor, which is designed to function at low angular velocities. In the high-TSR range, the vorticity generation around Savonius rotor buckets adversely impacts the Darrieus rotor performance and the hybrid VAWT. A dual-shaft configuration is proposed to mitigate this issue, which utilizes a drivetrain transmission system to prevent the Savonius rotor from exceeding its optimal angular velocity, thus acting as a control mechanism. The findings indicate that implementing the dual-shaft rotor resulted in a 35% improvement in (Formula presented.) within the low-TSR range and a 25% enhancement in the high-TSR range. This improvement is achieved when the inner rotor’s angular velocity is maintained at (Formula presented.), which has been determined to be the optimal value for the inner rotor. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dual-shaft Rotor; Hybrid Darrieus–savonius Vawt; Low- And High-tsr Range; Single-shaft Rotor","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85218903069"

Array of these rotors significantly increase energy production. Many studies on arrays employ two-dimensional Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) approach to simulate flow. However, insufficient exploration exists in literature between studies of single rotor and of Savonius arrays, particularly in understanding wake of Savonius turbines. Thorough understanding of wake characteristics using three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is crucial for efficient setup of arrays. This study examines wake by adjusting operational conditions of Savonius rotor. For a tip speed ratio (TSR) 1.0, approximately 50 % and 75 % of streamwise velocity is recovered at downstream distances of 4 and 7 rotor diameters (D) from centroid. Two-dimensional simulations cannot capture the wake accurately, as significant entrainment on advancing side occurs from z-direction. Vortical structures, characterized by Q-criterion and z-vorticity, are smaller at higher TSRs due to increased interaction with returning blade side. Novel integral momentum approach determines optimal downstream turbine position without simulating downstream rotor. It segregates downstream region into nine areas and analyzes momentum flux to account for varied recovery rates across z-planes.

However, their efficiency is limited, which restricts their commercial viability. This inefficiency is primarily due to the negative torque produced by the returning blades, which results in minimal power output. This study examines the effect of the aspect ratio on a new elliptic-shaped deflector using three-dimensional (3D) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling and an optimization approach. The aim of this novel deflector is to enhance the aerodynamic performance of the Savonius turbine by reducing negative torque during blade sweeping on the return side. Although there is extensive literature on elliptic-shaped bodies, there is a notable lack of research on the interaction between airflow over such a body used as a deflector and the Savonius rotor. This research uses an optimization methodology based on the design of experiments to determine the optimal design. Using the Taguchi method and analysis of variance, the number of blades is identified as the most significant factor, accounting for 77% of the rotor performance near the deflector. At a Tip Speed Ratio (λ) of 0.8, the optimal deflector achieves the highest average power coefficient of 0.34, representing a significant 42% improvement compared to the maximum average power coefficient without a deflector. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aspect Ratio; Cfd; Deflector; Optimization; Wind Turbine; Aerodynamic Drag; Deflection (structures); Taguchi Methods; Turbine Components; Vertical Axis Wind Turbine; Aspect-ratio; Computational Fluid; Deflector; Flow Dynamics; Flow Performance; Fluid-dynamics; Negative Torques; Optimisations; Power Coefficients; Savonius Rotor; Aspect Ratio","Aerodynamic drag; Deflection (structures); Taguchi methods; Turbine components; Vertical axis wind turbine; Aspect-ratio; Computational fluid; Deflector; Flow dynamics; Flow performance; Fluid-dynamics; Negative torques; Optimisations; Power coefficients; Savonius rotor; Aspect ratio","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85208946312"

Utilizing a 3D incompressible flow analysis based on the Navier-Stokes equation, this research explores and compares the turbine's effectiveness with varying screw pitches (0.5, 0.75, 1). The system of equations is solved numerically using ANSYS 2020 R2 fluid fluent. The performance assessment involves contrasting each proposed rotor against a pitchless semi-circle rotor. An innovative aspect of this work involves investigating the impact of asymmetry using two different ratios (2:1 and 3:1). Specifically, the lower half of the optimal pitch screw remains constant, while the upper half varies based on these ratios. To understand performance trends, the study employs visualizations of pressure, velocity contours, and streamlines to grasp the flow field and its underlying principles. Turbulent kinetic energy and eddy viscosity are also visualized. The results reveal an 18.25 % improvement in performance with the proposed rotor featuring a pitch screw of 0.5. Notably, the asymmetric rotor with a 2:1 ratio demonstrates the highest performance.

In order to ensure precise computational outcomes, grid independence studies are performed to impose the most optimum meshing conditions. Firstly, the aerodynamic performances of wing with and without WVWTs, and performance enhancers (winglet and wing-fences) are performed, so the decision has been made based on the resulting parameters obtained from the computational simulations. Secondly, aero-acoustics investigations are performed on all the imposed models, so the comprehensive outcomes are discussed.

The objective was to identify the optimal blade shape and radius yielding the best rotational speed, mechanical power, and efficiency for a two-stage vortex turbine. Specifically, the study examined parameters such as the Savonius shape and curvature, utilizing different blade ratios on two separate shafts. The turbines were configured with a telescopic system positioned at a distance of 10 cm apart. Each variation was subjected to loads ranging from 0.5 kg to 2 kg. Various performance metrics—rotational speed, torque, and water height—were assessed following load adjustments. Turbine Stage 1, employing the Savonius blade, achieved an optimal mechanical power output of 12.4 W, while Turbine Stage 2, utilizing a curved blade, reached a maximum mechanical power of 11.1 W. The Savonius blade demonstrated higher torque, operating more efficiently under greater loads. Notably, the water vortex with a larger air core experienced distortion caused by the turbine, leading to unstable flow. In contrast, implementing curved blades with a ratio of 0.5 provided the water vortex ample space to flow, resulting in a more stable vortex formation. Thus, carefully considering the optimal contact area and blade geometry is essential to minimize water vortex distortion in each turbine. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blade Geometry; Curved; Gravitational Water Vortex; Rotor-basin Ratio; Savonius; Two-stage","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85219013242"

The THRUST (The High Rotational Urban Savonius Turbine) project focuses on a small diameter Savonius rotor designed to withstand high wind speeds without a braking system. The experimental investigation was conducted in the Giovanni Solari Wind Tunnel at the University of Genoa, under smooth and turbulent flow. In addition to assessing flow conditions, key performance parameters such as torque, voltage, current, rotational speed, and rotor-generated noise were measured in the wind tunnel. Further investigations, including CFD simulations, have allowed to explore these effects in more detail and to interpret the rate of effective wind velocity increase caused by the wind tunnel blockage due to the presence of the wind turbine. This paper outlines the activities conducted, providing the description of the model, experiments, and measurements. As an example, a selection of results is presented, including power and torque curves, as well as acoustic emission measurements recorded near the rotor.

Findings revealed that all proposed configurations showed improved power coefficients over the standard design. The results showed that minimizing the geometry modification angle enhances the power coefficient. Additionally, reducing the blade's curvature was found to increase the power coefficient. Notably, configuration 7 achieved a 14.9% increase in power coefficient at a tip-speed ratio of 1.1.

The system combines the aerodynamic upgrades of the Darrieus rotor with the self-starting capability of the Savonius rotor, coupled with a rotary-linear generator to enhance power generation. Both the rotary and linear generators use a gear train to amplify rotational and linear motion for additional power output. The linear generator incorporates a Scotch -Yoke mechanism, which works alongside the rotary generator. The wind turbine system also features IoT -based wireless monitoring for real-time data acquisition, using INA219 sensors to measure current, voltage, and power, with the Blynk App for remote monitoring. The system was tested under both controlled and uncontrolled wind conditions, and its performance was simulated in MATLAB Simulink for theoretical output prediction. During the uncontrolled test, three setups (morning, noon, and afternoon) were tested, with ANOVA analysis showing significant differences in power generation due to varying wind speeds, especially higher speeds in the afternoon. In the controlled test, the system was tested in a closed environment using an industrial fan simulating wind speeds of 2.4m/s, 3.2m/s, and 3.6m/s.

Such wind speeds exist in many areas. One of the current challenges in the field of wind energy is the development of additional devices that direct the wind to the turbine blades to harness wind energy at such low speeds. This study examines the possibility of eliminating the harmful torque generated in a Savonius turbine by changing the direction of the wind acting behind the blades. A wind concentrator was developed to change the wind speed and then direct it to the rotor blades. The wind concentrator has two wind turbines with a vertical rotor and is designed to operate in areas with low wind speeds. The study focuses on observing changes in the speed of wind flow in a wind concentrator and turbine, changes in pressure acting on the blades, and moments of rotating force through both mathematical modeling and experiments. According to the research results, airflow speed of 5 m/s at the entrance to the wind turbine changed up to 8–9 m/s due to the wind concentrator. By directing the airflow to the concave surfaces of the rotor blades, no harmful torques were generated. As a result, the efficiency was 45–50% higher than that of a turbine without a concentrator. It was also found that the net pressure created in all turbine blades varies in the range of 25–40 Pa depending on the position of the blade and increases the power factor to 0.25. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Airflow; Concentrator; Model; Rotor; Speed; Wind Turbine","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009968655"

Wind power, especially in urban areas, has seen a significant growth. A critical consideration in the urban wind turbine installation is the noise impact on residents. This study investigates the noise generated by wind turbines under different operational conditions, comparing single-segment and five-segment rotor designs. Various acoustic analyses were conducted, including broadband analysis with weighting curves Z, A, C, and G, a narrowband analysis using 1/12 octave bands, and broadband calculations of sound quality indicators such as sharpness, roughness, and fluctuation strength (FS). The FS was also examined in the Bark scale frequency domain. The study linked the acoustic analysis with the rotor efficiency related to power production. The findings indicate that five-segment rotors generate less acoustic energy due to phase shifts, enhancing dissipation rates, and acoustic energy decreases with the increasing load, peaking when rotors are free at high revolutions per minute (RPM). While single-segment rotors show higher efficiency, they produce more noise. In contrast, five-segment rotors offer a better sound quality, making them preferable despite a lower efficiency.

The computational methodology involves Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes equations and the SST k-ω turbulence model to simulate the three-dimensional flow around the blades. The results show a deviation of 3.5% in the power coefficient for TSR 1.0 compared to the reported experimental data, thus validating the present computational approach.

In comparison to a non-valve single-stage modified Bach rotor, the two-stage rotor with an added valve exhibited a significant 68% reduction in static-torque fluctuation, a 4% increase in maximum power, and a noteworthy 17% improvement in average static-torque coefficient. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Augmentation; Check Valve; Renewable Energy; Savonius; Wind Turbine","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003163060"

Given Malaysia's hot and windy climate, it is essential to seize the opportunity to construct and operate the wind-powered generators. This study aims to build a working wind turbine with magnet levitation and compare its performance to the traditional wind turbine (i.e. without magnet levitation). The blade fan is made of thin aluminum plate, with a PVC pipe acting as the shaft and a neodymium magnet attached to the plate using Perspex. The copper coil-equipped rotor motor functions as a generator to supply current. An analysis is conducted on a Savonius vertical-axis wind turbine (VAWT) equipped with and without magnet levitation. The Savonius VAWT was designed and then tested with and without magnet levitation at the outdoor testing (natural environment). Overall, the results have indicated that the Savonius VAWT performance has improved with the use of magnet levitation as compared to not utilizing it. The mean values are increased by nearly 65% in wind power and torque, 77% in power output, 16% in speed ratio and also 20% in torque coefficient as a result of magnet levitation. All in all, it has been determined that the addition of magnet levitation can significantly enhance the output performance of the wind turbines by reduced friction when the shaft rotated. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Magnet Levitation; Savonius Vawt; Speed Ratio; Wind Power; Aluminum Pipe; Asynchronous Generators; Electric Motor Generator Sets; Electromagnetic Induction; Levitation Melting; Magnetic Levitation Vehicles; Turbine Components; Turbomachine Blades; Vertical Axis Wind Turbine; Green Technology; Hot Climate; Magnet Levitation; Malaysia; Performances Analysis; Power; Savonii Vertical-axis Wind Turbine; Savonius Wind Turbine; Speed Ratio; Vertical Axes Wind Turbines; Magnetic Levitation","Aluminum pipe; Asynchronous generators; Electric motor generator sets; Electromagnetic induction; Levitation melting; Magnetic levitation vehicles; Turbine components; Turbomachine blades; Vertical axis wind turbine; Green technology; Hot climate; Magnet levitation; Malaysia; Performances analysis; Power; Savonii vertical-axis wind turbine; Savonius wind turbine; Speed ratio; Vertical axes wind turbines; Magnetic levitation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105002995343"

This transformation, driven by the widespread use of smart sensors for traffic regulation, parking systems, and environmental monitoring, requires efficient, eco-friendly energy sources to reduce reliance on conventional batteries. In the city of Hail, wind energy presents a promising opportunity to generate clean power for low-energy sensors. This paper introduces a compact small wind energy harvesting system (SWEHS) that integrates piezoelectric and electromagnetic mechanisms designed specifically for powering sensors in low-wind environments. The harvester consists of two concentric rings: an inner rotator ring containing four equally spaced permanent magnetic plates arranged in a symmetrical pole configuration to minimize starting torque and improve power generation at low wind speeds. The outer ring incorporates four piezoelectric benders coupled with magnetic plates, converting mechanical energy into electrical power. Experimental results show that the Savonius rotor design outperforms Helical Savonius and Cup rotors, achieving a peak power output of 0.767 mW at a resistive load of 15 kΩ and wind speed of 6.5 m/s.

However, several undesirable characteristics hinder its commercial adaptation. One such characteristic is generation of negative torque by returning blade. To overcome this drawback, many techniques have been adopted, and one such technique is using slit or vent. In the paper, the performance analysis is carried out numerically using CFD approach and comparison between conventional semi-circular rotor, rotor equipped with capped vents and slits is carried out. As the performance of rotor is sensitive to vent location, two vent locations are selected, viz. 135° and 120° blade angle (β). Vent gaps, viz. 0.02D, 0.03D, and 0.04D, are chosen for analysis. Slit is analyzed at β = 120° and gap width of 0.03D and 0.04D. The probable physics related to flow around the rotor is discussed to analyze the reasons behind the obtained results. It is found that slit and vents deteriorate the performance (C<inf>P</inf>andC<inf>T</inf> values) compared to conventional Savonius rotor at all mentioned locations and gap sizes.

A Savonius rotor as a vertical axis wind turbine is especially suitable for small-scale energy generation units due to its straightforward design, economic viability, and efficiency in low wind speed areas. This report examines the impact of altering the zigzag pattern heights on the central area of the concave blade surface on turbine performance. The investigation was experimentally conducted to test the variation of such blade designs on turbine efficiency. The turbine performance parameters, including power and torque coefficients, were assessed.

However, the challenge of self-starting capability poses a potential obstacle for this turbine. This study addressed this issue by incorporating a Savonius rotor and introducing a Darrieus-Savonius hybrid rotor to enhance the aerodynamic performance and self-starting capability. The results demonstrated a substantial increase in power coefficient by 64% at tip speed ratio (TSR) = 1.4. Furthermore, the curtain installation was investigated as a mechanism to improve rotor performance. The findings indicated that the multiplication of a curtain enhanced the self-starting capability by controlling the positive pressure gradient on the suction and pressure sides of the rotor blades. Notably, considering the flow physics and rotor efficiency in the presence of the curtain with walls featuring different angles, it was established that the optimal angles for the upper and lower walls are 20° and 45°, respectively. This configuration led to a 35% increase in rotor efficiency compared to the solo hybrid rotor. The hybrid rotor demonstrated superior performance within the low-TSR range values, while the Darrieus control case exhibited better efficiency in the high-TSR range.

The flow structure around the Savonius and Darrieus rotors was numerically reconstructed, considering the mutual influence. From this reconstruction, the main stages of the vortex structure formation during the flow of the turbulent wind around the rotors were identified. Qualitative and quantitative assessments of the influence of the Savonius rotor on the total aerodynamic and energy characteristics of a VAWT were carried out. It is shown that the main contribution to the torque of the VAWT is due to the Darrieus rotor, mainly in the windward section of the trajectory. The Savonius rotor accounts for only a few percent of the total torque produced by the installation. The interaction of the Darrieus rotor blades with macrovortices from the Savonius rotor in the leeward part of the trajectory leads to a sharp drop in the torque coefficient. In the absence of a Savonius rotor, the vortices separated from supported tower are much smaller both in size and intensity. Therefore, their interaction with the blades of the Darrieus rotor does not lead to a significant change in the aerodynamic characteristics. A power characteristics comparison of two VAWTs showed that the torque coefficient is higher for wind turbines with only single Darrieus rotor. The developed approaches and techniques make it possible to reproduce real aerodynamic processes of flow most reliably around bodies of arbitrary shape and calculate their aerodynamic characteristics. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aerodynamics; Darrieus And Savonius Rotors; Mathematical Modeling; Navier-stokes Equations; Vertical-axis Wind Turbine; Wind Energy; Aerodynamics; Flow Structure; Turbine Components; Turbulent Flow; Vertical Axis Wind Turbine; Vortex Flow; Aerodynamic Characteristics; Darrieus Rotors; Energy; Mathematical Modeling; Navier-stokes Equation; Savonius Rotor; Structure Formations; Torque Coefficient; Vertical Axes Wind Turbines; Vortex Structures; Navier Stokes Equations","Aerodynamics; Flow structure; Turbine components; Turbulent flow; Vertical axis wind turbine; Vortex flow; Aerodynamic characteristics; Darrieus rotors; Energy; Mathematical modeling; Navier-Stokes equation; Savonius rotor; Structure formations; Torque coefficient; Vertical axes wind turbines; Vortex structures; Navier Stokes equations","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85207303516"

However, traditional VACHTs suffer from significant performance losses in the outer rotor when the diameter ratio is large and the startup dead zone issue of the inner Savonius rotor. To address these challenges, this study proposes a VACHT composed of an H-type rotor and a multi-blade (M-type) rotor, categorized into two structures based on counter-rotating and co-rotating operations. Numerical simulations reveal that the diameter ratio (f) has a greater impact on VACHT performance than the tip speed ratio. Counter-rotating allows the VACHTs to accommodate larger diameter ratios (f > 0.6) than co-rotation. The diameter ratio primarily influences the interference between the inner and outer rotors. The M-type rotor enhances the self-starting performance of both VACHTs, providing enhancements exceeding 200 %. Moreover, cluster arrangements of VACHTs benefit from increased power output due to enhanced blockage effects, with co-rotating VACHTs exhibiting higher gains (13.65 %) compared to counter-rotating VACHTs (9.84 %).

Darrieus and Savonius are vertical axis kinetic rotors, they are promising for generating power in low speed flows. The integrated Darrieus- Savonius hydrokinetic rotor works on the principles of integrated forces including lift and drag forces. An experimental investigation has been conducted to get the optimum configuration for Darrieus-Savonius integrated rotor in order to attain improved self-starting and high-power-factor in open channel water flow, under different inflow conditions. This study investigated the effects of the radius ratio, add-on angle, water heights, and flow velocity on performance of hydrokinetic integrated Darrieus-Savonius rotor with three standard NACA 020 airfoil shape as Darrieus rotor and single/double stage semi-circular blades as Savonius rotor on the power factor. Three radius ratios (R.R) namely (0.8, 0.6 and 0.4) and add-on angles of (0o, 30o, 45o, 60o and 90o) were studied. The experimental channel was (26 m) long water flume with a (1m wide ×1.2 m depth). The horizontal walls of the flume were made of glass with a strengthened frame, to permit visual examination. The flume entrance consisted of a receiving tank (3 m long, 1.5 m wide, and 0.75 m depth), a honeycomb pattern pipe box, and a screen box field with a large stone to dissipate the water turbulence and energy at the entrance. Two centrifugal pumps were used to supply water to the channel. Darrieus-Savonius integrated rotor was placed at distance equal to ten times width of the experimental channel, to avoid any turbulence and to make sure that the flow was steady. Based on the experimental results, it was observed that the optimum Cp values at λ (1.84), add-on angle of (45o) and R.R (0.4, 0.6 and 0.8) were (0.335, 0.29 and 0.299) respectively. The maximum hybrid performance was attained at R.R (0.4), add-on angle (45o) and tip-speed ratio (1.8) and Re (240x106) with value of (0.339). Decrease in the Re values by 25 % enhanced the performance by 1.19 %.

The maximum acceptable blockage is limited to 25 % for an open jet tunnel. The physics behind the inferior blockage capacity and their redressal is investigated. Hitherto, numerical models are developed to rectify the blockage troubles that introduce an additional complex case-based mathematical modeling to reckoning the results. In the current paper novel approach to redesigning the tunnel to solve blockage troubles is investigated that facilitates evading of mathematical techniques and securing accurate results straightforwardly. A hypothetical design incorporating the remedies is proposed, capable of conditioning the flow in a manner that debilitates the adverse effects of solid blockage, wake blockage, jet expansion, etc. The hypothesis is theoretically expounded by the boundary layer and jet flow phenomenon. The modified blower-type open jet wind tunnel constitutes a centrifugal blower, long inlet duct, plenum chamber around the test section, and collector. The modified wind tunnel is tested through experiments executed on four different-sized Savonius rotors creating 10 %, 30 %, 50 %, and 60 % blockage. The static pressure along the contours of the blades of rotors is obtained. The experimental results are juxtaposed with CFD results carried out at free-wind boundary conditions and standard classic experimental results performed in conventional wind tunnel at 11 % blockage. A blockage enhancement of 25 % is achieved by the approach of modification in the design of a conventional open jet wind tunnel. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Boundary Conditions; Boundary Layer Flow; Boundary Layers; Wind Stress; 'current; Adverse Effect; Blockage Effects; Boundary-layer Flows; Case Based; Flow Condition; Flow Phenomena; Jet Expansion; Jet Wind Tunnels; Jetflows; Computational Fluid Dynamics","Boundary conditions; Boundary layer flow; Boundary layers; Wind stress; 'current; Adverse effect; Blockage effects; Boundary-layer flows; Case based; Flow condition; Flow Phenomena; Jet expansion; Jet wind tunnels; Jetflows; Computational fluid dynamics","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85204385089"

Subsequently, amidst the ongoing quest for sustainable energy sources, wind energy has emerged as a reliable alternative. This has resulted in the development of various types of wind turbines. One of the most common types of vertical axis wind turbines is Savonius VAWTs. Despite possessing advantages, these turbines are less efficient compared to others. However, this shortcoming can be remedied by enhancing the aerodynamic performance of the turbines. This two-dimensional study examined the impact of placing an external object as a control rod at the rotor upstream or on the suction side by computational fluid dynamic methods. The rod was designed with circular, oval, dimpled, and bumpy cross-sections. The study evaluated different stagger angles for various diameter and distance ratios. The results showed that using a circular cross-section at a stagger angle = 30°, S/D = 1.5 and D/d = 2 increased efficiency by 40%. Implementing an oval cross-sectional design with stagger angle = 60° and S/D = 1 enhanced the rotor's efficiency to 90%.

This is particularly important for wind turbines, especially the drag-type Savonius turbine. This paper aims to investigate the effects of different endplate designs. Both experimental works and numerical simulations were conducted on a Savonius rotor with an aspect ratio of 1. A total of eight different endplate geometries and sizes were investigated. The mechanical torque and rotational speed were measured experimentally under various loads with an incoming wind speed of 5.89 m/s. The coefficient of torque (C<inf>T</inf>) and coefficient of power (C<inf>P</inf>) were calculated in both the experiments and simulations. The simulation was first validated using data from the literature, and flow characteristics were then scrutinized. The results indicate that the endplates greatly impact the turbine performance, with improvements of up to 299.7 % compared to a turbine without endplates from the experiment. The endplates help prevent flow leakage near the blade edges. In addition to tip losses reducing turbine performance, aerodynamic parasitic drag also contributed to a decrease in C<inf>P</inf> for the full endplate.

Mitigating this challenge necessitates finding the pattern of the variation through time in each wave cycle which, in turn, requires quantifying its repeatability over a large number of wave cycles. A Savonius rotor was thus experimentally investigated in a specially designed wave flume in this study. Using the techniques of image processing, individual frames of video footage of the various experimental runs were used to measure the instantaneous vertical position of the oscillating water surface and the driven turbine. Simultaneous video-based measurement of the motion of waves and the driven turbine was achieved for the first time in this study. These values were compared using statistical tools across multiple wave cycles to assess the degree of repeatability of the surface wave motion and the resulting rotational motion of the turbine. It was noted that the two types of motion were highly repeatable, however, their degree of repeatability was not constant throughout a wave cycle. Furthermore, the variation in motion of the driven turbine is, in general, less repeatable than that of the waves driving it. The study lays out a methodology for simultaneous video-based tracking and quantification of the repeatability of cyclic variations in wave-induced surface motion and that of the driven turbine. The experiments performed in this study provide strong evidence for the existence of a pattern in the variation of rotational motion of a wave-driven turbine. It thus serves as a foundation for mathematically expressing the variation, thus allowing designers to mitigate its effects and ensure a uniform supply of power from future ocean wave energy conversion devices based on turbines.

The rated power coefficient (C<inf>P</inf>) and its corresponding Tip Speed Ratio (TSR) are numerically obtained for an L16 (45) orthogonal array (OA). After the signal-to-noise ratio analysis, the optimal case is obtained. Results indicate that the configuration angles have the main effect on C<inf>P</inf>, the turbine spacing between the first and second rotors and the combination of rotation directions have the lowest effect. The optimal case is found to be (S<inf>12</inf> = 2D, S<inf>13</inf> = 2.4D, ϕ<inf>12</inf> = ϕ<inf>13</inf> = 70⁰, and RD = -, +, -), resulting in an increase of 19.69 % in C<inf>P</inf> compared to the isolated turbine at a rated TSR of 0.8. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cluster; Power Coefficient; Savonius Wind Turbine; Taguchi Method; Two-stage Rotors; Taguchi Methods; Turbine Components; Cluster; Performance Enhancements; Power Coefficients; Power Performance; Rotation Directions; Savonius Rotor; Savonius Wind Turbine; Taguchi's Methods; Tip Speed Ratio; Two Stage Rotors; Vertical Axis Wind Turbine; Airflow; Array; Cluster Analysis; Drag Coefficient; Optimization; Performance Assessment; Signal-to-noise Ratio; Three-dimensional Flow; Unsteady Flow; Wind Turbine","Taguchi methods; Turbine components; Cluster; Performance enhancements; Power coefficients; Power performance; Rotation directions; Savonius rotor; Savonius wind turbine; Taguchi's methods; Tip speed ratio; Two stage rotors; Vertical axis wind turbine; airflow; array; cluster analysis; drag coefficient; optimization; performance assessment; signal-to-noise ratio; three-dimensional flow; unsteady flow; wind turbine","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201865886"

The objects of this study include a main cylinder (MC) and a cylindrical system outfitted with a pair of rotors of different types (with Banki rotors, Darrieus rotors, and Savonius rotors, denoted as WBR, WDR, and WSR), and the VIV responses are analyzed within the Reynolds number range of 0.8 × 103≤Re ≤ 5.6 × 103. The findings indicate that all three kinds of rotors show excellent vibration suppression effect in downstream and cross-flow directions by adjusting the VIV response (amplitude, frequency, hydrodynamic coefficient) and vortex pattern (vortex mode, wake shape). The maximum amplitude suppression rate can reach 99% for the Banki and Savonius cases at high reduced velocity. Within the whole velocity range, the maximum amplitudes of WBR, WDR, and WSR cases in the downstream and cross-flow directions were 0.32 and 0.45 times, 0.73 and 0.65 times, and 0.28 and 0.33 times, respectively, compared to the maximum amplitude of MC. The time-averaged drag coefficient of the controlled cylinder in the WBR case was minimized to about 0.015. The Banki rotor and Savonius rotor significantly reduced the vibration frequency of the VIV system compared to the Darrieus rotor. Especially, the Banki rotor could keep the VIV system vibration frequency within a narrow range at different reduced velocity. Moreover, the vorticity contour of the VIV system with assembled rotors was significantly improved, with a narrower flow wake width and more regular vortex shedding at high reduced velocity. Considering both amplitude suppression and drag coefficient, Banki rotors were recommended. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Flow Control; Quasi-active Control Method; Vibration Suppression Rotor; Vortex Pattern; Vortex-induced Vibration; Cylinders (shapes); Drag Coefficient; Hydrodynamics; Machine Vibrations; Reynolds Number; Vibration Analysis; Vortex Shedding; Vorticity; Wakes; Active Control Methods; Maximum Amplitude; Quasi-active Control Method; Reduced Velocity; Vibration Response; Vibration Suppression; Vibration Suppression Rotor; Vibration Systems; Vortex Induced Vibration; Vortex Pattern; Vortex Flow; Amplitude; Computer Simulation; Cylinder; Drag Coefficient; Dynamic Analysis; Dynamic Response; Flow Control; Flow Field; Hydrodynamics; Numerical Model; Structural Analysis; Structural Response; Vibration; Vortex Flow; Vortex Shedding; Wind Turbine","Cylinders (shapes); Drag coefficient; Hydrodynamics; Machine vibrations; Reynolds number; Vibration analysis; Vortex shedding; Vorticity; Wakes; Active control methods; Maximum amplitude; Quasi-active control method; Reduced velocity; Vibration response; Vibration suppression; Vibration suppression rotor; Vibration systems; Vortex induced vibration; Vortex pattern; Vortex flow; amplitude; computer simulation; cylinder; drag coefficient; dynamic analysis; dynamic response; flow control; flow field; hydrodynamics; numerical model; structural analysis; structural response; vibration; vortex flow; vortex shedding; wind turbine","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201296031"

Dual VAWTs present challenges in terms of wake interactions and noise, particularly in urban areas. Optimizing these parameters is essential for future wind energy adoption. This research is the first to analyze how the interaction of wakes from adjacent rotors, combined with a deflector, affects both the aerodynamic performance and noise levels of dual Savonius rotors. Large Eddy Simulation is applied, as it effectively captures detailed turbulent wind flows and their interactions with wind turbines. A multi-objective optimization method combining Machine Learning and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is developed to optimize rotors for maximum power efficiency and minimum noise, considering their wake interactions with a unique deflector system. First, the influence of geometric parameters on aerodynamics and aeroacoustics characteristics of rotors is analyzed, and the database is generated using Design of Experiment approach. Next, the CFD model is replaced by Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model established for predicting rotor performances. A Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm method is used to optimize aerodynamics and aeroacoustics characteristics of rotors. Finally, optimal design parameters are identified from the Pareto front using the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution decision-making method.

The Savonius turbine has emerged as a promising solution for harnessing wind energy in urban environments due to its unique design, simplicity, structural stability, and ability to capture wind energy from any direction. However, the efficiency of Savonius turbines poses a challenge that affects their overall performance. Extensive research efforts have been dedicated to enhancing their efficiency and optimizing their performance in urban settings. For instance, an axisymmetric omnidirectional deflector (AOD) was introduced to improve performance in all wind directions. Despite these advancements, the effect of wind incident angles on Savonius turbine performance has not been thoroughly investigated. This study aims to fill this knowledge gap by examining the performance of standard Savonius configurations (STD) compared to the basic configuration of the deflector (AOD1) and to the optimized one (AOD2) under different wind incident angles and wind speeds. One key finding was the consistent superior performance of this AOD2 configuration across all incident angles and wind speeds. It consistently outperformed the other configurations, demonstrating its potential as an optimized configuration for wind turbine applications. For instance, at an incident angle of 0°, the power coefficient of the configuration of AOD2 was 61% more than the STD configuration. This ratio rose to 88% at an incident angle of 20° and 125% at an incident angle of 40°. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aerodynamics; Cfd Simulation; Power Coefficient; Savonius Rotor; Transient Three-dimensional Simulation; Vertical Axis Wind Turbine; Wind Deflector","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85207709339"

The efficiency of the Savonius rotor can be improved by modifying the blade profile to increase the effective torque. However, past research works reported that modifying the blade profile is quite challenging due to small C<inf>p</inf> improvement and design constraint. Therefore, the present study proposes a newly developed blade profile blueprint, akin to parameterizable designs such as the modified Bach and Benesh profiles but offering more shape versatility. This new blueprint is optimized with a systematic design of experiment (DOE) using a 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation to maximize the C<inf>p</inf>. The best design is determined statistically using the Taguchi method and analysis of variance (ANOVA). The optimized rotor profile enhances C<inf>p</inf> by approximately 10.9 % compared to the conventional Savonius rotor at the optimal TSR (best C<inf>p</inf> = 0.159) and 16.7 % improvement at a higher TSR value of 0.9 (C<inf>p</inf> = 0.158). Moreover, the optimized rotor outperforms the Fibonacci rotor (Fibonacci blade profile) by 27 % in terms of efficiency. A thorough CFD analysis suggests that the optimized blade profile has a greater lift generated at the convex side of the advancing blade due to its streamlined shape, which delays the flow separation further up to the root of the blade. The confirmation test (experiment) is also performed to verify the C<inf>p</inf> improvement of the optimized rotor, and the results herein concluded that the present CFD prediction is accurate and consistent with the experimental values. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","3d Cfd Savonius Turbine; Engineering Shape Optimization; Low Reynolds Number; Savonius Blade Profile Optimization; Savonius Hydrokinetic Turbine; Savonius Mosaic Meshing; Savonius Water Experiment; Sliding Mesh Method; Taguchi Method; Analysis Of Variance (anova); Cost Effectiveness; Design Of Experiments; Environmental Impact; Flow Separation; Reynolds Number; Safety Factor; Shape Optimization; Taguchi Methods; Turbine Components; Turbomachine Blades; 3d Computational Fluid Dynamic Savonii Turbine; Blade Profile Optimizations; Engineering Shape Optimization; Hydrokinetic Turbines; Low Reynolds Number; Savonii Blade Profile Optimization; Savonii Hydrokinetic Turbine; Savonii Mosaic Meshing; Savonii Water Experiment; Savonius Turbine; Shape-optimization; Sliding Mesh Methods; Taguchi's Methods; Computational Fluid Dynamics; Computational Fluid Dynamics; Experimental Study; Optimization; Performance Assessment; Turbine","Analysis of variance (ANOVA); Cost effectiveness; Design of experiments; Environmental impact; Flow separation; Reynolds number; Safety factor; Shape optimization; Taguchi methods; Turbine components; Turbomachine blades; 3d computational fluid dynamic savonii turbine; Blade profile optimizations; Engineering shape optimization; Hydrokinetic turbines; Low Reynolds number; Savonii blade profile optimization; Savonii hydrokinetic turbine; Savonii mosaic meshing; Savonii water experiment; Savonius turbine; Shape-optimization; Sliding mesh methods; Taguchi's methods; Computational fluid dynamics; computational fluid dynamics; experimental study; optimization; performance assessment; turbine","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195298706"

To enable the implementation of small-scale wind turbines for dispersed electricity generation in cities, it is crucial to evaluate their performance in close proximity to buildings. This study aims to assess the performance of conventional Savonius rotors near a circular cross-sectional building for the first time. The performance of a Savonius wind rotor is being studied at different installation angles (30°, 45°, 60°, and 90°) with a constant non-dimensional gap space (S/D) of 2.0 between the rotor center and building envelope under a constant free-wind speed of 6 m/s. Two possible wind rotor rotation scenarios, inward and outward, are thoroughly tested and studied. Computations are carried out for tip speed ratios (TSR) of 0.4, 0.8, and 1.2. The obtained results are successfully validated for both the Savonius rotor in the free-wind flow (without a building) and a circular cross-sectional building (without a wind rotor) as well. The results show that installing a Savonius rotor at angles of 60° and 90° provides the maximum power coefficient based on the TSR. In contrast, placing the rotor at 30° reduces its performance even more than the reference case. For optimal rotor angles, inward rotation is preferred over outward rotation regardless of the TSR. Finally, there are improvements of 208.72 %–439.95 % compared to the reference case for 60° and 90° under inward rotation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Installation Angle; Inward And Outward Rotations; Power Coefficient; Savonius Wind Rotor; Tall Buildings; Wind; Wind Turbines; Installation Angle; Inward And Outward Rotation; Performance; Power Coefficients; Savonius Rotor; Savonius Wind Rotor; Savonius Wind Turbine; Tip Speed Ratio; Urban Areas; Wind Rotor; Rotation","Tall buildings; Wind; Wind turbines; Installation angle; Inward and outward rotation; Performance; Power coefficients; Savonius rotor; Savonius wind rotor; Savonius wind turbine; Tip speed ratio; Urban areas; Wind rotor; Rotation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195287926"

Two significant strengths of vertical-axis wind turbines relative to horizontal-axis models are their capacity to initiate rotation under minimal wind conditions and their versatility to operate effectively regardless of wind direction. This paper explores the innovation of smart hybrid vertical axis wind turbines, which combine drag and lift principles for enhanced performance with a focus on rotor switching mechanisms to optimize performance across varying wind conditions. The methodology involves experimental investigations using a small hybrid Savonius-Darrieus model, with 14cm height and 10cm diameter. The data indicates that the optimal rotor switching occurs at a tip speed ratio of 1.7. The turbine is designed to operate in hybrid mode at tip speed ratios below 1.7 and switch to single Darrieus mode at higher tip speed ratios. Performance evaluation metrics include tip speed ratio, moment coefficient, and power coefficient. Results indicate that the smart hybrid model exhibits superior performance compared to traditional hybrid and single Darrieus configurations. Through empirical studies and computational analysis, the Smart Hybrid model shows significant enhancements, with a 175% increase in initial torque compared to single Darrieus model and a 12.12% improvement in maximum power coefficient compared to traditional hybrid configurations. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","And Vertical Axis Wind Turbine; Hybrid; Moment Coefficient; Power Coefficient; Rotor Switching; Tip Speed Ratio; Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine; Hybrid Power; Vertical Axis Wind Turbine; And Vertical Axis Wind Turbine; Darrieus; Hybrid; Moment Coefficient; Performance; Power; Power Coefficients; Rotor Switching; Tip Speed Ratio; Vertical Axes Wind Turbines; Windmill","Horizontal axis wind turbine; Hybrid power; Vertical axis wind turbine; And vertical axis wind turbine; Darrieus; Hybrid; Moment coefficient; Performance; Power; Power coefficients; Rotor switching; Tip speed ratio; Vertical axes wind turbines; Windmill","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85204061318"

To address this, a new wind-powered artificial mixing system is designed and experimentally tested for various Savonius rotor combinations (three-stage and four-stage rotors). These turbines directly utilize wind energy to draw air into the water column for aeration, bypassing the need for electrical conversion. The rotor performances were tested in terms of power and torque coefficients. Additionally, these rotors were tested for artificial mixing efficiencies in a specially designed water tank that can mimic thermal stratification typically observed in an actual water supply reservoir. Among the rotors, the three-stage rotor with a 60° phase shift was found to exhibit superior power and torque coefficients, achieving a power efficiency value of 0.14. As for the mixing efficiency, the four-stage rotor with a 45° phase shift excelled in mixing efficiency, reaching 95%. Practitioner Points: A new wind-powered artificial mixing system is designed and tested for various Savonius rotor combinations. While keeping the total rotor height constant, the three-stage Savonius rotor class shows superior performance against the four-stage Savonius rotor class in terms of power and torque efficiency.

Some of these nets passively kill ocean life and seabirds and damage marine vessels. Finding them is a needle-in-a-haystack problem and is extremely resource-intensive. We propose a new technological solution for neutralizing fishnets drifting at the ocean surface: a fishnet-harvesting buoy. This passive system finds ghost nets due to the difference in speed between the buoy and the drifting fishnets. The buoy catches them with its arms by entanglement, wrapping the fishnets around it. Rotation is wind-driven using a Savonius vertical axis wind rotor or cup-type rotor installed on the buoy. Once the net is caught, the buoy is tagged for collection. Many buoys are needed for such a decentralized solution to collect fishnets. However, ocean cleaning can be done at different locations simultaneously instead of at one centralized location. We formulate the concept of the fishnet-harvesting buoy and evaluate its feasibility for catching nets in the ocean. We propose a first design of a spar-buoy type and do the first analytical evaluations of its performance. We quantify the buoy's weight as a function of its diameter and draft. We quantified how much ocean surface a single buoy can clean as a function of its size and how many buoys are needed to clean garbage-dense areas. We found that regular redeployment of the buoys and an efficient decentralized collection system with vessels are key factors for success. The next steps after the technology concept evaluation in this study are to develop scaled prototypes, optimize the buoy's design and performance by engineering, test them in a lab environment, and deploy and test full-scale models in the ocean. This new concept provides a promising complementary solution to the current collection of surface-drifting ghost nets, as this concept could be less intensive on human and environmental resources. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Drift; Ghost Net; Ocean; Oceanography; Sustainable; Wind Rotor; Function Evaluation; Harvesting; Oceanography; Decentralised; Drift; Ghost Nets; Marine Vessels; Ocean; Ocean Surfaces; Ocean Technology; Performance; Sustainable; Wind Rotor; Buoys; Buoy System; Conceptual Framework; Design; Drifter; Equipment; Feasibility Study; Fishing Gear; Model Test; Performance Assessment; Technology Adoption; Waste Management","Function evaluation; Harvesting; Oceanography; Decentralised; Drift; Ghost nets; Marine vessels; Ocean; Ocean surfaces; Ocean technology; Performance; Sustainable; Wind rotor; Buoys; buoy system; conceptual framework; design; drifter; equipment; feasibility study; fishing gear; model test; performance assessment; technology adoption; waste management","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195391538"

The characteristics of the turbine are driven for the range of water speed of 0.5 to 2.0 m/s and TSR of 0.3 to 1.5. It is observed from numerical analysis that the flow speed of water significantly affects the mean torque and static torque established by the hybrid turbine. The torque developed by the hybrid turbine enhances as water speed increases. However, the structure of the Savonius blade can alter the torque characteristics of the turbine. The mean torque and static torque growth by the hybrid turbine with a Savonius helical blade angle of 0˚ is more optimum than the hybrid turbine with a Savonius helical blade angle of 180˚.

Savonius vertical axis wind turbines (VAWT) have high potential as a turbomachine. Optimization methods such as flow injection on the rotor suction side to flow control on buckets developed as Savonius VAWTs operating range and efficiency are lower than other VAWTs. In this study, the semi-directional airfoil guide vane (SDAGV) was introduced to improve the aerodynamic performance and increase the efficiency of Savonius VAWT. The results indicate that the vane installation at the lower upstream of the rotor yields a power coefficient (C<inf>p</inf>) of 0.12, representing a 140% growth compared to a single Savonius rotor. Furthermore, this installation extended the operating range of the turbine from a tip speed ratio (TSR) of 0.51–0.8. According to the results, it was found that more passages could improve efficiency. Five types of symmetrical airfoil profiles were evaluated for the guide vane. The NACA0010 airfoil profile, which has lower thickness than the others, obtained 7% higher efficiency than the base case consisting of NACA0012.

The major challenge is harnessing the same from the run-off river streams or canals that have low free-stream flow-speed (less than 1 m/s). Savonius hydro-kinetic turbine can self-start in such flow streams, but it exhibits poor efficiency. This study proposes a novel airfoil-shaped curved winglet that can enhance the functionality of this turbine. The popular semi-circular blade is replaced with a hybrid blade profile consisting of a curved winglet at the front-edge, which is tore out from NACA 63415 airfoil, followed by a straight blade section up to the trailing edge, thereby resulting in a modified Savonius hydro-kinetic turbine. The curved winglet minimizes negative torque effect on the rotor, while the long straight edge offers a greater moment-arm and gap-flow. The research is performed in two stages. In the first stage, three different models of the turbine with various combinations of blade overlapping, side clearance, and winglet offset are designed. Transient Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are run to assess and compare the model performances under different low flow-speeds. Taguchi optimization is then performed to obtain a combination of best design and operating conditions for higher performance. In the second stage, two more design variables of the winglet, namely winglet arc angle and cut-out arc section are introduced on the previous best model and detail analysis is done to further improve the turbine performance. Finally, the two best models are compared to obtain important performance insights of the turbine. Results show that winglet parameters with best cut-out arc section and offset improve performance more than the performance with traditional overlapping or side clearance design considerations. The maximum Cp and C<inf>T</inf> of 0.36 and 0.75 are obtained for the best model at the best winglet arc angle (a<inf>1</inf>) of 30° for flow-speed 0.4 m/s, and TSR 0.7 with combinations of 20 % blade overlapping, 6.14 % side clearance, and 15 mm winglet offset. The performance parameters of the turbine is also compared with the existing modified Savonius-turbine designs to emphasize the essential improvement of the current design. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Coefficient Of Performance; Flow Physics; Hybrid Blade Profile With Winglet And Straight Section; Low Flow-speed; Modified Savonius Hydro-kinetic Turbine; Taguchi Optimization; Airfoils; Computational Fluid Dynamics; Kinetic Energy; Rivers; Stream Flow; Taguchi Methods; Turbine Components; Turbomachine Blades; Blade Profile; Coefficient Of Performance; Flow Physics; Flow Speed; Hybrid Blade Profile With Winglet And Straight Section; Kinetic Turbines; Low Flow; Low Flow-speed; Modified Savonii Hydro-kinetic Turbine; Taguchi Optimizations; Kinetics","Airfoils; Computational fluid dynamics; Kinetic energy; Rivers; Stream flow; Taguchi methods; Turbine components; Turbomachine blades; Blade profile; Coefficient of Performance; Flow physics; Flow speed; Hybrid blade profile with winglet and straight section; Kinetic turbines; Low flow; Low flow-speed; Modified savonii hydro-kinetic turbine; Taguchi optimizations; Kinetics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85196480841"

An effective turbine design is necessary for optimizing power extraction even in scenarios with minimal head.

Over the past century, numerous studies have aimed to refine the design of the Savonius rotor, yet there remains no consensus on the ideal configuration for these turbines. Addressing this, the current study introduces a novel approach with detailed 3D transient simulations to enhance the water turbine performance via blade modifications, transitioning from traditional analyses that primarily focus on wind turbines. This research develops and analyzes five unique turbine geometries, each varying in blade number, diameter, and angular positions. A detailed numerical analysis was conducted using the sliding mesh technique to assess their impact on turbine efficiency and output, using an inlet water velocity of 0.5 m/s and a tip speed ratio ranging from 0.7 to 1.3. Findings indicate that a two-blade turbine configuration achieves the highest torque coefficient of 0.295, which is 2.41 times higher than that of a four-bladed design with equal blade diameter at a tip speed ratio of 0.7.

This device effectively injects flow and controls positive pressure gradient accumulation, reducing unfavorable drag on the convex part of the returning bucket.

The major problem of SHT is the lower power coefficient in comparison to other types of hydrokinetic turbines. Assuming a constant flow rate in an open channel, the mean velocity of the current hitting the rotor is a function of the free surface height, thus it can be considered as a parameter which is effective on the SHT performance. In this investigation, firstly, an experimental test is conducted on a SHT in an open channel with a certain free surface height. Experimental data of the turbine power coefficient at different tip speed ratios are applied for validation of the numerical method. Transient numerical simulation is conducted using ANSYS CFX 22.2 software. Two-phase flow simulation is done using Homogenous multiphase model. In a constant flow rate, runaway tests are conducted for evaluating free surface level at the channel inlet and outlet. The free surface heights at the channel inlet and outlet are applied as boundary conditions for numerical analysis. Numerical simulation at a constant volumetric flow rate and also constant tip speed ratio show that reducing free surface height, the turbine power increases up to 5.17 times the power produced by the turbine having the highest free surface level. The maximum power is generated when the free surface is tangent to the upper plate of the rotor and it is fully submerged.

This study aims to investigate and compare the performance characteristics of Savonius rotors using two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) analysis approaches. The primary objective is to determine the optimal analysis method for evaluating the rotor's performance. The simulations were conducted using ANSYS software, considering six different tip-speed ratios (TSRs) ranging from 0.2 to 1.2, and three wind speed categories (7 m/s, 5 m/s, and 3 m/s). The hybrid shear-stress transport (SST) k-omega was used as the turbulence model. The results indicate that the 2D analysis approach, which simplifies the rotor's geometry by assuming rotational symmetry, provides reasonable estimations of the rotor's performance. However, the 3D analysis captures the intricacies of the rotor's actual geometry, accounting for the effects of non-uniform flow and vortex shedding, which can significantly influence the rotor's performance. The comparative analysis reveals that the 3D analysis predicts higher torque and power coefficients than the 2D approach, especially at higher wind speeds. At TSR 1.0, the torque and power coefficient obtained from the 3D approach are 6.56 Nm and 0.102, respectively meanwhile 2D approach gains 6.28 Nm torque and 0.098 for power coefficient. This research contributes to a better understanding of the performance characteristics of Savonius rotors and highlights the importance of considering three-dimensional effects in their analysis. The findings can guide the design and optimization of Savonius rotor systems, leading to improved wind energy conversion efficiency and enhanced utilization of renewable energy resources. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2d And 3d Analysis; Performance Analysis; Renewable Energy; Savonius Rotor; Wind Energy","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186900559"

The preferment of the present design over the original one with a semicircular shape is confirmed by the sequence of unsteady two-dimensional (2D) numerical simulation. The results demonstrate a new power coefficient peak (up to 16.5 % better than that of the original rotor) could be gained at the tip speed ratio (TSR) of 1.1.

Insight into the flow dynamic, including pressure, velocity, streamline, and wake analysis, reveals that the thick blade near the overlap region, benefiting in terms of the turbine's high performance. The airfoil blade increases the momentum energy around the rotor, changes the pressure on the concave side, and varies the origin of the pressure force, leading to an increase in the moment arm with more torque exhibited on the rotor at high TSR. In addition, the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) analysis is also performed to better understand the flow phenomena behind the rotor.

It possesses a substantial capacity of 75,000MW, constituting around 17.8% of the overall renewable energy portfolio in the country. However, hydropower installations in Indonesia account for only 0.061% of the available potential, leaving a considerable gap. One effort to bridge the gap is the development of a water turbine. Because Savonius has been a popular turbine in recent years, this research was conducted using one. Because of the Savonius’s simple structure, it is simple to modify. This study aims to determine how the number and size of fins affect the performance of the Savonius water turbine. Computational Fluid Dynamics with two-dimensional analysis was used in this study. The Fluent Solver and the Ansys Student version software were used in this study. The variations included no fins, one fin, and two fins on the rotor. The k-shear Stress Transport (SST), which produces accurate findings by combining the k-model for free flow and the standard k-model for boundary (wall) flow. Inlet velocities of 0.3m/s, 0.65m/s, and 0.9m/s were utilized for the research simulations. At a flow velocity of 0.65m/s and a TSR of 0.77, the power coefficient is increased by 13.8% by adding two fins compared to the configuration without fins. The findings were subsequently subjected to a two-factor factorial design analysis. The findings indicate that the number of fins and the TSR factor exert a substantial impact.

However, VAWTs still suffer from low conversion efficiency. As a result, tremendous efforts are being exerted to improve their efficiency, which mainly focus on two methods, regardless of whether the study is a CFD simulation, a field test, or a lab test experiment. An active approach involves modification of the rotor itself, such as the blade design, the angle, the trailing and leading edges, the inner blades, the chord thickness, the contra-rotating rotor, etc., while the second approach involves passive techniques where the flow is directed to optimally face the downwind rotor by mounting guiding vanes such as a diffuser or other shapes at the upwind position of the rotor. Among all the techniques undertaken, the counter-rotating wind turbine (CRWT) rotor technique seems to be the most effective, with an output comparable to that of horizontal-axis wind turbines (HAWTs), while the Savonius rotor has received more attention compared to other VAWT designs. Apart from technological issues, it has also been suggested that geographical issues, such as proper site siting of a wind turbine rotor at a particular location where a uniform flow can be guaranteed, are of paramount importance to ensure an effective conversion capacity of wind turbines. Thus, this study has successfully highlighted the latest improvements in augmentation methods and has established a solid foundation for future research aimed at improving the efficiency of VAWTs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aerodynamic Performance; Cfd; Contra-rotating Technique; Darrieus Rotor; Rotor Optimization; Savonius Rotor; Vertical-axis Wind Turbine (vawt); Aerodynamics; Computational Fluid Dynamics; Conversion Efficiency; Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine; Turbine Components; Wind Turbine Blades; Aero-dynamic Performance; Contra-rotating; Contra-rotating Technique; Darrieus Rotors; Optimisations; Rotating Technique; Rotor Optimization; Savonius Rotor; Vertical Axes Wind Turbines; Vertical-axis Wind Turbine; Vertical Axis Wind Turbine","Aerodynamics; Computational fluid dynamics; Conversion efficiency; Horizontal axis wind turbine; Turbine components; Wind turbine blades; Aero-dynamic performance; Contra-rotating; Contra-rotating technique; Darrieus rotors; Optimisations; Rotating technique; Rotor optimization; Savonius rotor; Vertical axes wind turbines; Vertical-axis wind turbine; Vertical axis wind turbine","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85197311113"

The goal of idealization is to simplify the intricate interactions between the Savonius and Darrieus components. The simulation actuator surfaces with uniform force distributions lead to a cost-effective way to identify the optimal force distribution of each turbine component. The numerical model was validated against momentum theory. The results demonstrated that the numerical and theoretical results yield similar predictions in the low-thrust cases but show differences in the high-thrust cases. The maximum power coefficient (Formula presented.) of an idealized hybrid VAWT with given thrust coefficient (Formula presented.) is lower than that of a single actuator. This is a consequence of the nonoptimal loading on the actuator. The results indicate that an idealized hybrid VAWT does not show a significant power increase compared with an optimal single Darrieus rotor. Therefore, the presence of a Savonius rotor inside a Darrieus rotor leads to a lower power output in any circumstance.

Unfortunately, it has a poor efficiency due to the exertion of negative torques during its returning sweeps. Recently, the technique of controlled dynamic venting has been shown to reduce this negative torque on a two-bladed Savonius rotor while preserving its omnidirectional capability. That investigation was extended in this numerical study by refining the controllable flaps of the same rotor to improve its performance using a two-stage optimization procedure. In the first stage, the design parameters of the controllable flaps were optimized using the Taguchi and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) methods. In this analysis, the flap length was found to be the most significant parameter affecting the rotor performance with a contribution ratio of 79.8%, in contrast to a ratio of only 6.7% by the least effective parameter: the flap opening angle. The first optimization stage produced an improvement of 16.7% on the average power coefficient (C<inf>P</inf>) of the vented rotor, compared to the unvented one, at the optimal tip-speed ratio (TSR) of 1.0. In the second stage, the flap length was refined further to a shorter flap of 22.5% of the blade length, resulting in an improvement of 21% on the same metric at the same TSR. Crucially, these controllable flaps only used an energy cost of 6.1% of the total energy produced by the rotor, a significant improvement from the 12.2% energy cost obtained in the previous study. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Controllable Flaps; Dynamic Venting; Optimization; Rotor Performance; Savonius Turbine; Taguchi Method; Analysis Of Variance (anova); Turbine Components; Controllable Flap; Dynamic Venting; Energy Cost; Negative Torques; Optimisations; Rotor Performance; Savonius Turbine; Taguchi's Methods; Tip Speed Ratio; Vertical Axis Turbines; Taguchi Methods; Electronic Equipment; Experimental Design; Optimization; Torque; Wind Turbine","Analysis of variance (ANOVA); Turbine components; Controllable flap; Dynamic venting; Energy cost; Negative torques; Optimisations; Rotor performance; Savonius turbine; Taguchi's methods; Tip speed ratio; Vertical axis turbines; Taguchi methods; electronic equipment; experimental design; optimization; torque; wind turbine","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85187953894"

Savonius is a drag-type turbine. Drag force on the surface is affected by roughness or wavyness. The purpose of this study is to analyze the impact of applying wavy (zigzag) variations to the concave surface of Savonius blades on their performance. This was achieved by the use of 3D computational fluid dynamics simulation at TSR 0.6 with a velocity inlet of 5 m/s. The model was semicircular, zigzag on the concave surface on semicircular with t = 0.75, t = 0.25, and t = 1 mm. The result of this study’s CRDR maximum is 1, 817 at the zigzag model with t = 1 and CRDR avrg =1.24. The average drag coefficient increased by 14 percent compared to the conventional semicircular rotor. The maximum Cp value is also found at t = 1 mm, which is 0.315. The power coefficient increased by 29 percent compared to the conventional semicircular rotor. The total pressure on the blade shows the highest model with t = 1 mm at the same angle of attack (α = 30).

Conventionally, assessing these forces relies on the inundation depth of the colliding tsunami passing without the presence of the terrestrial structure. However, it is essential to consider the inundation depth and incident fluid velocity, as both significantly influence the resulting tsunami forces. In this research, ANSYS Fluent 17.2 is employed to simulate excitation sources using a Defined Function (UDF) code within a C++ framework. The dynamic meshing technique is adopted to replicate the interactions between the bore pressure of the tsunami and an idealised vertical wall structure across three distinct water levels. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modelling demonstrates the proposed methodology's capability to offer precise impact pressure distributions concerning geographical and temporal aspects. The findings reveal specific instances: at a water depth of 10 m, the maximum Froude number is attained at 3.5 and 6.9 seconds, corresponding to a maximum pressure value of 3.9x105 Pa at 3.85 seconds for a water flow velocity of 20 m/sec.

However, their suboptimal performance remains a significant challenge due to the generation of higher unproductive torque. This paper aims to address this issue by obtaining an optimal blade profile considering the power coefficient (C<inf>P</inf>) as an output function using optimization techniques. The objective function includes the overlap ratio, intermediate points on the curve, inlet velocity, and tip speed ratio (TSR) as the optimization geometric parameters. To achieve this, the simplex search method and the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II are opted to develop the blade profile. The blade profile is developed using a natural cubic spline curve with fixed end points and variable intermediate points along with other parameters. The computational analysis is done using ANSYS FLUENT software with shear stress transport k−ω turbulence model. The solver setup employs the finite volume method to simulate the transient 2D flow around the blade profile. A direct comparison is made between the optimized blade profile and the conventional semicircular one over a range of TSRs. The results clearly indicate the superior performance of the former, exhibiting a higher C<inf>Pmax</inf> by 23% compared to the conventional one at TSR = 0.8.

This combined turbine incorporates asynchronous reverse rotation of inner and outer rotors, where the external rotor is an H-type, while the internal rotor adopts the Savonius configuration. This arrangement ensures that both rotors operate at their optimal tip speed ratios, thereby maximizing operational efficiency while reducing the startup flow velocity of the system. Computational fluid dynamics software was employed to analyze the influence of the tip speed ratio of the internal rotor and the diameter ratio of the combined turbine on the performance of the external H-type rotor and the combined turbine. The static torque coefficient of the combined turbine at different flow angles was investigated by the numerical calculation method. The results show that when the diameter ratio is less than 0.4, variations in the tip speed ratio of the internal rotor have minimal impact on the efficiency of the external H-type rotor. However, as the tip speed ratio of the internal rotor exceeds 0.5, it starts to consume more power, resulting in a decrease in the overall system efficiency. Additionally, flow field analysis reveals that due to the differing rotational speeds of the internal and external rotors, a higher diameter ratio in the combined turbine leads to pronounced phase interference between the two rotors. This interference causes increased torque fluctuations in the external rotor and shortens the operational lifespan of the device. Therefore, a diameter ratio ranging from 0.2 to 0.4 and a tip speed ratio of the internal Savonius rotor between 0.2 and 0.5 are recommended. The combined turbine exhibits a significant increase in static torque coefficient in most flow directions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Asynchronous Reversal; Combined Hydrokinetic Turbine; H-type Rotor; Savonius Rotor; Computational Fluid Dynamics; Efficiency; Flow Velocity; Torque; Turbines; Asynchronoi Reversal; Combined Hydrokinetic Turbine; Diameter Ratio; H-type Rotor; Hydrokinetic Turbines; Internal-rotor; Savonius Rotor; Static Torque; Tip Speed Ratio; Vertical Axis; Numerical Methods","Computational fluid dynamics; Efficiency; Flow velocity; Torque; Turbines; Asynchronoi reversal; Combined hydrokinetic turbine; Diameter ratio; H-type rotor; Hydrokinetic turbines; Internal-rotor; Savonius rotor; Static torque; Tip speed ratio; Vertical axis; Numerical methods","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85193491542"

The LBM approach was coupled with a rotor rotation analysis. In the LBM framework, the non-orthogonal central moment model was employed for the precise computation of particle collisions. Additionally, the direct forcing method was used to consider the rotating blades and shaft. Consequently, the torque exerted on both advancing and returning blades and rotor output was successfully simulated. These simulations unveiled the inherently unsteady rotational behavior of the rotor, stemming from the variable torque acting upon the blades. Moreover, the computational results exhibited a notable agreement between the simulated flow pattern around the rotor and the experimental visualization.

In the current study, a hypothetical design of a low-cost and simple wind tunnel has been proposed to produce similar flow characteristics but by using fewer components viz. blower, inlet duct, plenum chamber, test section, and collector, which is the novelty of the current design. The basis of the hypothesis is to obtain fully developed flow at the exit of the duct, produce moving belt-type lid-driven cavity flow inside the plenum chamber, create a low-speed movable membrane at the boundary of the main jet, and cessation of free jet expansion to a significant amount inside test section. The new design is validated through numerical and experimental results as well as mathematical modelling. The values of the ratio of standard deviation and average of normalized velocity are found in the range of 10−2 for a 50% blockage cross-section.

Its shape and the fact that the Savonius vertical axis wind turbine runs at relatively low wind speeds with high torque values makes it suitable for practical uses such as that of an irrigation system in agriculture industry. This paper utilizes numerical research with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to investigate the performance of a vertical-axis wind turbine. The ANSYS CFD program was engaged to construct the simulations during the pre-and post-processing stages. Wind speed remained constant while the angular velocity was altered to enable analysis of the flow through the wind turbine. Because of its mechanical simplicity, the primary profile of a semicircle has remained a typical option for turbines that generate high torque based on drag force. The effects of using elliptical curves and the fluctuation in thickness along the profile chord were both examined in this study. Equivalently, an attempt to optimize the rotor's design was made. After the performance of a numerical simulation, a geometry consisting of simple circle arcs was developed, with a 10.9% improvement in the power coefficient, analogous to prior optimizations with more complicated geometries. The numerical results derived include the torque coefficient evolution throughout a full rotation as well as the distribution of vorticity magnitude at different rotor points. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cfd; Power Coefficient; Renewable Energy; Savonius; Tsr; Vawt","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184911917"

The device comprises a Savonius-type turbine and a radial flux permanent magnet electromagnetic generator. The two are magnetically coupled so that, while the turbine is submerged in the water flow, the generator operates in air. The device is cylindrical with a diameter of 0.8 cm and a length of 7.2 cm and, when inserted through a hole in a pipe wall so that only the turbine protrudes into the flow, it presents a cross-sectional area to the flow of only 1.25 cm2.

Nevertheless, traditional Savonius wind energy systems suffer from high negative torque and low efficiency. Therefore, the optimization of the blade shape of the Savonius wind turbine is an effective approach to enhance the use of clean and sustainable wind energy. In this work, selecting supplementary blades with quarter elliptical shapes is proposed to optimize the aerodynamic efficiency of the Savonius rotor by enhancing the amount of captured wind at minimal cost. The turbulence model SST/k–ω is used in ANSYS fluent to numerically simulate the performance of the rotor with supplementary blades. As a function of tip speed ratio (TSR), the torque coefficient (Ct) and power coefficient (Cp) are computed. Furthermore, the total pressure, velocity, and streamlines are estimated and analyzed. The results showed that the supplementary blades have the ability to enhance the output power of the turbine by lowering the negative drag behind the returning blade. Overall, the new configuration enhances the suction vortices and reverses flow, leading to better aerodynamic performance.

The present numerical study proposed a novel deflector system to guide the incoming water stream effectively and to improve the hydrodynamic performance of the conventional Savonius turbine rotor. The combined deflector system comprises two deflectors: a newly proposed wedge-shaped triangular deflector and a circular cylindrical deflector. The triangular deflector is placed upstream of the returning blade, and the circular deflector is positioned upstream of the advancing blade. Different configurations of the proposed deflector system are obtained by varying the dimensions and location of the triangular deflector (deflector 1), while the diameter and location of the circular deflector (deflector 2) are fixed in all configurations.

Based on the calculations that have been carried out, it is found that the dimensions of the wind turbine model used in this research are a turbine height of 1 meter with a diameter of 0.5 meters. Meanwhile, the dimensions of the shaft used are 20mm. Model testing has been carried out in Juanda Surabaya, it is known that the generator power produced increases along with increasing wind speed which is also influenced by the rotation of the wind turbine. In the results of this research, the largest generator power was produced at a wind speed of 4.8 ms-1, which produced a generator power of 12.6 watts. Meanwhile, the lowest power is 0 watts because a wind speed of 0.4 m/s is not able to rotate the wind turbine. From the data collection results, it was also found that the SCC could only charge the battery if the minimum voltage reached 13 volts. So the new SCC can charge the battery at a wind speed of 3.7 m/s with a voltage output of 13.1 volts and a current strength of 0.5 amperes. This research will use a Savonius wind turbine with 2 rotor blades with dimensions of 1 meter high and 0.5 meter diameter. The research results show that power is obtained at a generator voltage starting from 13.1 volts which produces a current strength of 0.7 amperes. It is at this voltage that the new Solar/Wind Charge Control can charge the battery. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85213939714"

In particular, they can be efficient for charging batteries in remote locations where there is no centralized power supply (including in the Arctic, Far East, etc.). They can also be used as part of missions to planets with atmospheres. One of the promising design solutions for a small wind power generator with a vertical axis of rotation is a hybrid device. It consists of two wind turbines that have a common axis of rotation: external (Darrieus wind turbine) and internal (Savonius rotor). This scheme represents a compromise between the relatively high power coefficient of the Darrieus turbine and the good startup characteristics the Savonius rotor. It is known that one of the typical battery charging modes is constant current charging. Here we consider a hybrid installation, the generator of which is connected to a current stabilizer. The load is simulated with an active resistance. It is assumed that the generator is a DC generator. A closed mathematical model of the studied system is constructed. The aerodynamic load is described using the quasi-steady approach. It is assumed that the characteristic time of electrical processes is much smaller than the characteristic time of mechanical processes. The influence of load resistance on the behavior of the system is investigated. It is shown that, under certain conditions, several steady modes (up to five) exist in the system. In this case, at least two of them are attracting. Therefore, the hysteresis of the angular speed of the steady mode is possible when the load resistance changes. It should be noted that in a number of situations, an unstable steady mode (which corresponds to a lower angular speed of the turbine than a stable one) may be preferable (for example, to reduce the load on bearings). In this regard, a resistance control strategy has been proposed to ensure stabilization of the unstable stationary regime. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Control; Stability; Stabilization; Steady Motion; Wind Power Generator","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85209749852"

The blade’s profile shape is one of the main parameters determining the turbine’s performance. The novelty of the work presented here is that it investigates the performance of the various parabolic profiles on the turbine to arrive at an optimum design. The position of the parabola’s vertex is varied to produce forty-eight parabolic profiles, but each design’s overall diameter remains constant. The shear stress transport k- ω turbulence model is used to solve two-dimensional unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations at a Reynolds number of 0.891 × 105.

The possibilities of solar and wind components to improve each other's performance usually stay out of consideration, not impossible though. We suggested using vertical bifacial solar panels arrays to increase the wind cross-section area, those are not radial but inclined, so are guiding the flow at the optimal angle to the rotor and reducing the drag of the returning blade. Enhanced air flow reduces the temperature of solar panels. Shading by neighbor deflectors was minimized considering the overall effect on system output. We have simulated the airflow in such a system to see the effect of the suggested approach, which turned out to be rather impressive: in poor wind conditions we got the annual energy output yield of 205 and for good wind conditions of 28 compared to the classic Savonius rotor, and those were greater than 12-fold wind cross-section increase. We have also optimized the rotor shape according to the new airflow conditions, which also has given additional yield compared to the Savonius rotor. Our special rotors have shown better performance at low wind speeds with cut-in below 1 m/s.

However, in view of the wide distribution and poor sustainability of Internet of Things (IoT) nodes powered by batteries, traditional sensor technology has limited the development of distributed wind vector monitoring. Herein, we propose a multifunctional electromagnetic generator for omnidirectional wind energy harvesting and self-powered wind vector detection. A Savonius turbine structure is constructed to convert the wind blowing into the rotation of a magnet-embedded rotor, which then induces a voltage in wound coils fixed on a stator. On this basis, average power of 2.16-237.57 mW is obtained with a matched load under the wind speed of 1.80-4.50 m/s, where a superior minimum cut-in wind speed as low as 1.80 m/s is achieved. It is also revealed that the wind speed can be indicated by the root-mean-square value of the induced voltage, with the electromagnetic generator serving as a self-powered wind speed sensor without any external power supply. Besides, results show that an integrated photoelectric wind direction monitoring module has reached a resolution of 10°.

According to earlier research, this hybrid can produce higher torque at low tip speed ratios than a solo Darrieus model. However, as tip speed ratio increase, hybrids tend to perform lower than solo Darrieus. This study introduces an innovative paradigm termed rotor switching theory. It suggests switching from hybrid to solo Darrieus rotation at higher tip speed ratio for the turbine. Current study is conducted experimentally using testing models of small hybrid Savonius-Darrieus and solo Darrieus turbines. The internal rotor consists of two stages of Savonius turbines with a 0.2 overlap and a bucket angle of 135°, each having two blades. The external rotor features a NREL S809 Darrieus airfoil with a 5 cm cord length and three blades. Outer radius is 10 cm and its height is 15.4 cm. The experiments are conducted within an open-circuit wind tunnel with the wind speed variations of 3 - 12 m/s. Based on the results, the intersection of the moment and power coefficient graphs for both the hybrid and solo Darrieus occurs at TSR 1.7. When reaching this condition, switching the turbine rotation state from hybrid to solo Darrieus can offer advantages. By employing this concept, the turbine will achieve an expected initial power coefficient that is 150% better than the solo Darrieus and a maximum power coefficient that is 21% greater than the hybrid model. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Hybrid Savonius-darrieus; Moment Coefficient; Power Coefficient; Solo Darrieus; Switching; Tip Speed Ratio; Aerodynamics; Flow Visualization; Turbine Components; Vertical Axis Wind Turbine; Wind Stress; Wind Turbine Blades; Darrieus; Energy Sector; Hybrid Savonii-darrieus; Moment Coefficient; Power Coefficients; Solo Darrieus; Tip Speed Ratio; Turbine Performance; Vertical Axes Wind Turbines; Windmill","Aerodynamics; Flow visualization; Turbine components; Vertical axis wind turbine; Wind stress; Wind turbine blades; Darrieus; Energy sector; Hybrid savonii-darrieus; Moment coefficient; Power coefficients; Solo darrieus; Tip speed ratio; Turbine performance; Vertical axes wind turbines; Windmill","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85207467692"

This study uses the Taguchi optimization method to enhance the performance of a cluster of three hybrid Darrieus-Savonius vertical-axis wind turbines. The optimized parameters include distances between adjacent turbine centers, configuration angles, rotational directions, and the pitch angle. The study is the first to investigate the effect of varying the pitch angle of Darrieus airfoil blades on hybrid design performance. The optimal configuration of the three hybrid VAWTs and the isolated rotor is analyzed through flow velocity, pressure, and turbulence kinetic energy contours. The results show that the pitch angles have the greatest effect on the rated power coefficient among other studied influencing parameters. The optimal cluster configuration's performance improvement is due to the favorable velocity gradient around the blades. Compared to the isolated rotor, the power coefficient enhancement for the optimal case is 46.545% at the rated tip speed ratio of 3.08. The hybrid rotor in the cluster can achieve almost the same power as the isolated rotor up to a tip speed ratio of 4.1 instead of 2.86 for the isolated rotor. However, the decrease in overall efficiency for some cluster configurations is due to wake flow intensity and trapping between the rotors, which causes a stagnation zone. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Turbine Components; Vertical Axis Wind Turbine; Cluster Configurations; Darrieus; Optimisations; Pitch Angle; Power Coefficients; Power Performance; Savonius Rotor; Tip Speed Ratio; Vertical Axes Wind Turbines; Kinetic Energy","Turbine components; Vertical axis wind turbine; Cluster configurations; Darrieus; Optimisations; Pitch angle; Power coefficients; Power performance; Savonius rotor; Tip speed ratio; Vertical axes wind turbines; Kinetic energy","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85207185320"

For many years, there has been a great deal of interest in wind energy because it is a clean and sustainable source. Because of its less expensive cost and its autonomy from wind direction, the Savonius rotor, as vertical axis turbine, has the advantage of being appropriate for certain implementations as a conversion device for energy. From this perspective, multiple studies have been conducted to promote its efficiency. The focus of this study is the helical Savonius wind rotor (HSWR) which has not been overly investigated. Experimental tests were realized with the use of HSWR manufactured via 3D printing machine in a wind tunnel. The torque and power coefficients were addressed to assess the rotor experimental performances. Next, a numerical study was undertaken through Ansys Fluent 17.0 software. Good compliance was achieved, which validated the numerical model with a mean error equivalent to 5%.

Studies on alternate unconventional power sources have received more serious consideration. The conversion of wave energy is among several essential types of green energy. Among the frequently utilized methods for converting wave energy is the Oscillating Water Column (OWC) device. This study investigates the efficiency optimization of OWC devices by enhancing the performance of air turbines. The study is primarily concerned with the performance of air turbines performing as power take-off in OWC systems. The OWC analytical formulas for output power and overall efficiency are illustrated in this paper. The modelling and operation of a Savonius S-type rotor-based counter-rotating vertical axis wind turbine (CRWT) is investigated in this paper using a computational simulation approach. Using the software ANSYS, modelling and numerical simulation are carried out. Better performance properties can be observed in the counter-rotating model compared to a single-rotor design. The results show that these turbine adjustments contribute to noticeable enhancement in turbine performance, which directly affects the optimization of OWC efficiency. In comparison to a single-rotor wind turbine design (SRWT), the counter-rotating design has improved properties in terms of torque, power, and their corresponding coefficients. The CRWT system generates more than twice the maximum power of an SRWT. At a speed of 9 m/s, the maximum output power of CRWT is 18 W, while the power of the individual bottom rotor at the same speed is limited to 3 W. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Air Velocity; Ansys; Oscillating Water Column Wave Energy Converters; Power Output; Srwt","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205978760"

The novel blade shape proved to outperform the HSWR in terms of maximum power coefficient improvement with 29.5% and 22.58% experimentally and numerically, respectively. The novel blade displayed a dual merit.

Water in rivers, canals, artificial waterways and hydroelectric farms has the kinetic energy and this kinetic energy could be converted into mechanical and then electrical energy. A Savonius turbine is a turbine capable of converting the kinetic energy of these resources into mechanical energy. In the present work, a Savonius turbine with optimized geometrical design parameters is proposed based on the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling using the dynamic mesh approach. Dynamic mesh is frequently utilized in simulations of rotating equipment, oscillating structures or fluid–structure interactions. Firstly, 3D CFD investigation has been carried out to settle the geometrical parameters of the Savonius rotor which were taking hold of performance of the turbine. For this purpose, computational fluid dynamics investigation with dynamic mesh capability combined with 6dof has been exercised. Thereafter, experiments were carried out on the optimized turbine rotor for the validation of its output parameters. The results intimates that the aspect ratio (AR) 1.0–1.4 and overlap ratio (OR) 0.15–0.20 are better performance. The study concluded that, the dynamic mesh method combined with 6 DOF is more precise and accurate for simulating the Savonius hydrokinetic turbine than the static mesh method. The optimized parameters of the Savonius turbine are showing a considerable increase in the power output of the Savonius turbine. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ann; Aspect Ratio; Coefficient Of Power; Coefficient Of Torque; Dynamic Mesh Model; Overlap Ratio; Savonius Turbine; Hydraulic Turbines; Hydroelectric Power; Windmill; Ann; Aspect-ratio; Coefficient Of Power; Coefficient Of Torques; Computational Fluid; Dynamic Mesh; Dynamic Mesh Model; Mesh Modeling; Overlap Ratios; Savonius Turbine; Mesh Generation","Hydraulic turbines; Hydroelectric power; Windmill; ANN; Aspect-ratio; Coefficient of power; Coefficient of torques; Computational fluid; Dynamic mesh; Dynamic mesh model; Mesh modeling; Overlap ratios; Savonius turbine; Mesh generation","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205125358"

Due to their low noise emission, they can be used in urban areas close to end users. However, their biggest drawback is their relatively low aerodynamic performance. One solution to this challenge is to use flexible rotor buckets. Public literature has shown that a wing’s aerodynamic performance can be improved by introducing flexible material; however, this idea has not been widely studied in the case of a Savonius turbine. Therefore, this work presents an experimental and analytical study determining how turbine performance is affected by the flexibility of the rotor bucket. In particular, the effect of the leading edge design is examined. In total, three rotor designs are studied in a continuously operated wind tunnel to reveal the effects of rotor design on the rotational speed and rotor deformation at different flow velocities. In addition, a correlation is developed to predict the turbine power coefficient under the measured operating conditions. The results suggest that a flexible membrane bucket can improve the performance of a Savonius turbine compared to a conventional rigid design. It is also found that the amount of leading edge flexibility can affect the optimal operating range. High-speed camera studies provide further insights into the bucket deformations during the operation of different rotor designs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Flexible Rotor; Savonius Turbine; Wind Turbine; Aerodynamics; Flexible Wings; Rigid Rotors; Turbine Components; Aero-dynamic Performance; Climate Condition; Flexible Rotors; Lower Noise; Robust Devices; Rotor Design; Savonius Turbine; Savonius Wind Turbine; Simple++; Turbine Performance; Wind Turbines","Aerodynamics; Flexible wings; Rigid rotors; Turbine components; Aero-dynamic performance; Climate condition; Flexible rotors; Lower noise; Robust devices; Rotor design; Savonius turbine; Savonius wind turbine; Simple++; Turbine performance; Wind turbines","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85204500857"

The wind known to be a sustainable and clean energy source has whetted extensive interest over decades. As an energy converter, Savonius vertical axis wind rotor has the advantage of being suitable for particular applications owing to its lower cost and independency on wind direction. From this perspective, multiple studies have been conducted to promote its efficiency. This research work emphasizes on the helical Savonius wind rotor (HSWR) which has not been too much exanimate. In a wind tunnel, experimental tests were realized with a 3D printed HSWR. Numerical study was performed via Ansys Fluent 17.0 software. Good accordance was obtained. Boosting, numerically, the efficiency of the HSWR using a novel deflector placed upstream the rotor constitutes the objective of this work. The basic idea is to harvest the incoming wind to the forward blade and to preclude the backward blade. To procure the optimal deflector design, different configurations were proposed through the optimization of the deflection and the arc angles. The optimized deflector improved the HSWR power coefficient with 25% while improving its aerodynamic characteristics. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aerodynamic Properties; Helical Savonius Wind Rotor; Novel Deflector; Performance; Wind Tunnel; Deflection (structures); Error Correction; Structural Dynamics; Wind Stress; Windmill; Aerodynamic Properties; Electrical Power; Helical Savonii Wind Rotor; Human Welfare; Novel Deflector; Numerical Investigations; Performance; Rotor Performance; Savonius Wind Rotor; Sustainable Energy Sources; Wind Tunnels","Deflection (structures); Error correction; Structural dynamics; Wind stress; Windmill; Aerodynamic properties; Electrical power; Helical savonii wind rotor; Human welfare; Novel deflector; Numerical investigations; Performance; Rotor performance; Savonius wind rotor; Sustainable energy sources; Wind tunnels","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85203142696"

The present work investigates experimentally and computationally the effects of combining two different blade shape configurations into a single blade shape design on the Savonius rotor performance. The concave and convex sides of Savonius rotor blade were made unsimilar in shape. Three rotor blades differ in configuration were experimentally and computationally tested including the combined blade. The computational results were primarily validated against experimental data and accordingly a suitable turbulence model was chosen. Among few tested turbulence models, the realizable k-ε turbulence model showed closest agreement with the measured data. The results of turbine performance indicate that the combined blade shows better performance than other models particularly at higher tip speed ratios. The maximum power coefficient of the combined blade is increased by about 10% when compared with other investigated rotors. This may be attributed to the blade shape effects on the resulting total drag force. Increasing the maximum power coefficient in addition to the operational range of tip speed ratio are expected when running Savonius turbine with the combined blade. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blade Shape; Combined Blade; Computational Fluid Dynamics (cfd); Savonius Rotor; Wind Power","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202819025"

Because of the intense wind speeds in such areas, wind energy is exclusively used in the country's coastal regions. Savonius VAWTs can run at low speeds, making them suited for use in South Africa's interior regions. However, the power conversion efficiency of the Savonius VAWTs could be better. As a result, they must be modified. Changes to the rotor configuration are expected to boost positive aerodynamic torque. This study used numerical and analytical approaches to investigate the effect of blade overlap on the power coefficient, static torque coefficient, and overlap ratio. The study also sought to investigate wind flow interactions. For performance evaluation, the combined blade configuration was used. To solve the uRANS governing equations for numerical analysis, the Spalart–Allmaras turbulence model was employed using ANSYS Fluent 2022 R2. This numerical approach helped determine the power coefficient and velocity ratio at different time steps. The mathematical definition of torque was employed in obtaining the static torque coefficient when the angle of attack was altered for the analytical analysis. The power coefficient-time graph revealed that at a 0.2 tip speed ratio, the power coefficient ranges between 0.06 and 0.1, with a maximum velocity ratio of 0.333.

Vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs) particularly Savonius rotors operate at a lower tip-speed-ratio (TSR) range compared to horizontal axis wind turbines (HAWTs). The Savonius rotor has good starting characteristics, making it suitable to be placed in urban areas with lower wind speeds. Due to its low efficiency, studies on augmentation and optimization have been conducted to improve its blade and deflector designs. Extensive research has established a common consensus that the use of endplates significantly improves the aerodynamic performance of the Savonius rotor. However, limited research has been undertaken to explore the endplate design further. In this study, wind tunnel tests were conducted on different endplate ratios, to investigate the effects of endplate design on the aerodynamic performance of a conventional Savonius turbine. Three different Savonius rotor with no endplate, semi-circular endplate and circular endplate were designed and manufactured. Experiments were conducted in an open-type suction wind tunnel at a constant measured wind velocity of 5.89 m/s. The turbine's performance for different endplate ratios was evaluated across a TSR range of 0.2 to 1.0. The performance was assessed based on the maximum power generated and its self-starting ability. From the experimental results, the circular endplate ratio of 1.1 shows a significantly high coefficient of power compared to both semi-circular and without endplates. This is due to reduced spanwise spillage and enhanced airflow capture by the rotor. The endplates direct incoming air to the advancing blade and overlap region, resulting in the increased pressure difference between the concave and convex sides of both the advancing and returning blade, thereby improving the power efficiency of the turbine with 1.1D diameter endplate and semi-circular endplate by 296.6% and 6.9% compared to no endplates case. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Coefficient Of Power ( Cp); Coefficient Of Torque ( Ct); Endplates; Savonius Turbine; Vertical Axis Wind Turbine; Wind Tunnel Test; Aerodynamics; Fossil Fuels; Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine; Vertical Axis Wind Turbine; Wind Power; Wind Stress; Aero-dynamic Performance; Coefficient Of Power; Coefficient Of Torque; Coefficient Of Torques; Endplates; Savonius Rotor; Savonius Turbine; Vertical Axes Wind Turbines; Wind Tunnel Tests; Wind Tunnels","Aerodynamics; Fossil fuels; Horizontal axis wind turbine; Vertical axis wind turbine; Wind power; Wind stress; Aero-dynamic performance; Coefficient of power; Coefficient of torque; Coefficient of torques; Endplates; Savonius rotor; Savonius turbine; Vertical axes wind turbines; Wind tunnel tests; Wind tunnels","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199364421"

Among different types of HKTs investigated by various researchers, a cross-flow turbine is considered as most suitable device to harness the hydrokinetic potential in canal and riverine applications. Thus, the present study aims to numerically investigate various cross-flow turbines such as advanced Savonius, Darrieus and hybrid HKT rotors. In order to compare their performance, rotor of these turbines having the same diameter of 150 mm and number of blades as 3 under constant flow velocity of 1.0 m/s is considered.

Even though it performs poorly, vertical-axis hydrokinetic turbines use the Savonius rotor. The object of research is a Savonius rotor model with additional grooves. The study addresses the need to improve the efficiency and overall performance of Savonius rotor models in hydrokinetic turbines, which are widely used for harnessing energy from flowing water currents. The problem involves understanding how different groove configurations affect the aerodynamic behavior and energy extraction efficiency of the Savonius rotor in hydrokinetic turbine applications. The test results revealed that incorporating grooves led to notable improvements in efficiency ( ) and coefficient of drag (CD). Grooved blades exhibited a maximum efficiency of 30.97 % and a maximum drag coefficient of 2.71. Notably, blades with a groove width of 12.5 mm emerged as the optimal model, demonstrating an efficiency peak of 35.66 % and a drag coefficient 3.08. This indicates a substantial increase in efficiency by 4.69 % and a corresponding rise in the drag coefficient by 0.37 for grooved blades. The grooves on grooved blades increase friction, improving performance. Grooved rotor blades improve turbine performance significantly. Savonius rotor models in hydrokinetic turbines extract more energy by optimizing groove width and arrangement to maximize drag coefficient and efficiency. This research affects hydrokinetic turbine design and optimization for renewable energy generation.

One of them is wind energy, which is generated by a wind turbine. Savonius, a type of vertical axis wind turbine, is a small-scale energy conversion device suitable for low wind speeds, such as those characteristic of Indonesian wind speed. The objective of the current study was to analyze the impact of implementing a tiered-height zigzag pattern on the concave surface of the Savonius blade. The zigzag angle operates to direct the wind toward the reverse blade, consequently augmenting the pressure on the reverse blade. In addition, the tiered-height zigzag pattern in the concave surface increases the area of the turbine that is in contact with the wind, which in turn generates more energy. This study used an open-type wind tunnel to conduct experiments as the primary technique of investigation. Its performance was assessed in terms of power and torque coefficients. Additionally, experiments were conducted with other standard semi-circular blades to get a direct comparison. According to the findings of the experiments, incorporating a tiered-height zigzag pattern into a concave surface may produce a power coefficient (Cp) that is 16 % higher than that of a semi-circular. The highest Cp was 0.286 at a TSR of 0.55 and U = 6 m/s. In this case, the Savonius wind turbine's ability may be elevated by including a tiered-height zigzag pattern in the Savonius concave surface. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Coefficient Of Power; Concave Surface; Savonius Rotor; Tiered-height Zigzag; Wind Energy","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188425824"

In this study, a detailed comparison of widely used analytical wake models with CFD studies on static and dynamic Savonius Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (S-VAWT) is done. The CFD studies involve solving the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations using finite volume method-based Ansys Fluent. The comparative investigation showed that the analytical wake models reported in the literature are capable of predicting wake characteristics such as the wake width; however, they fail to predict the wake velocity deficit.

The results indicate that the highest aerodynamic performance is provided by the rotor with the elliptical blades, with a notable increase in the power coefficient of about 80% in comparison to the classic semi-circular profile. To further enhance the efficiency of the Savonius wind turbine, a twin-rotor configuration using the elliptical blades was studied. The results indicate a further enhancement in the power coefficient, reaching 110% compared to a single rotor with semicircular blades. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blade Shape; Savonius; Sst K-ω Model; Twin-rotor; Urans; Vertical Axis Wind Turbine","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85179700458"

In this study, the optimum s-rotor design is created using the aspect ratio, overlap ratio, quarter blade gap ratio, and fin as parameters. The effective levels of each parameter were found by performing Computational Fluid Dynamic analysis. Then, using the Responds Surface Optimization method, optimum parameter levels were determined, and the optimum s-rotor design was created.

The degradation of the blade surface caused by corrosion can impact the blade's hydrodynamic and the structural performance. This paper reports a one-way three-dimensional fluid-structure interaction simulation to analyse the performance of a static Savonius hydrokinetic turbine at varying rotor positions, with different surface roughness and water velocities, in terms of coefficients of static torque, static torque, stresses, and blade deformation. The simulations revealed that the optimum position for the highest coefficient of static torque was at 15° (C<inf>st</inf> = 0.30) in reference to the water flow. Increasing the water velocity from 0.4 ms−1 to 0.84 ms−1 improved the turbine static torque due to an increase in the kinetic energy. However, the presence of surface roughness has deterioration effects on the static torque coefficient due to a delayed separation which causes a drag reduction. The simulation predicted no structural failure at 0.4 ms−1 and 0.84 ms−1, but varying materials exhibited varying maximum principal stress and deformation, highlighting the significance of the early development of materials selection process. The maximum von Mises stress and deformation was obtained when the turbine is resting at 45° for aluminium blade (σ = 1.05 MPa, ε = 5.6e−4 mm). The results of this study indicate suitable materials from a hydrodynamic and material perspectives for the construction of the Savonius hydrokinetic turbine, which can be implemented in the design process to potentially save cost and minimize turbine downtime. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Fluid Structure Interaction; Hydrokinetic Turbine; Renewable Energy; Savonius Turbine; Surface Roughness; Corrosion; Deterioration; Energy Dissipation; Failure (mechanical); Flow Of Water; Fluid Structure Interaction; Fracture Mechanics; Hydraulic Motors; Kinetic Energy; Kinetics; Surface Roughness; Torque; Turbine Components; Turbomachine Blades; Coefficient Of Static Torques; Fluid Structure Interaction Analysis; Fluid-structure Interaction; Hydrokinetic Turbines; Renewable Energies; Savonius Turbine; Static Torque; Stress And Deformation; Vortical Flows; Water Velocities; Hydrodynamics; Alternative Energy; Fluid-structure Interaction; Hydrodynamics; Kinetic Energy; Surface Roughness; Turbine","Corrosion; Deterioration; Energy dissipation; Failure (mechanical); Flow of water; Fluid structure interaction; Fracture mechanics; Hydraulic motors; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Surface roughness; Torque; Turbine components; Turbomachine blades; Coefficient of static torques; Fluid structure interaction analysis; Fluid-structure interaction; Hydrokinetic turbines; Renewable energies; Savonius turbine; Static torque; Stress and deformation; Vortical flows; Water velocities; Hydrodynamics; alternative energy; fluid-structure interaction; hydrodynamics; kinetic energy; surface roughness; turbine","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177838838"

This study intends to explore the influence of key design parameters consisting of the number of blades, blade chord length, helical angle, and J-shaped blade on the performance and selfstarting ability of a Darrieus VAWT. Furthermore, implementing an efficient optimization model to obtain maximum power based on the numerical findings. To achieve this, two different numerical modeling approaches, namely Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Double Multi-Streamtube (DMST), have been applied. The results indicated that employing a higher blade number and chord length enhances the starting capability of the turbine. Moreover, increasing the helical angle to 60° reduces the generated torque fluctuations.

Although Savonius wind rotor produces negative static torque coefficient at every rotor angle, it has been used for simple construction. The curtain has been used to control the wind flow direction in upstream side of the rotor. The performance investigation of the rotor has been done in ANSYS fluent. The focus of the numerical investigation is to increase the Savonius Wind Turbine (SWT) efficiency with and without curtain arrangement in upstream rotor side. As the rotor speed increases with increase of wind speed, so curtain guide the flow direction. The RANS turbulence model is exploited for simulating the fluid flow in front of the rotor. From the simulation it is found that the non-dimensional performance parameters i.e power coefficient (Cp) and torque coefficient (Ct) increases with increase in Tip Speed Ratio (TSR) without curtain design.

This phenomena demonstrates a significant divergence in the utilization of fossil energy sources against new renewable energy sources. The impact of fossil energy sources is the occurrence of global warming and non-renewable energy sources, a transition process to clean energy produced from renewable energy is required. Hydro, wind, and bioenergy are all possible renewable energy sources in Indonesia. The potential for converting wind energy into electrical energy in Indonesia is relatively large, at 159 GW. The rotor in the wind turbine is one of the primary components that plays a part in reversing the kinetic energy of the fluid into electrical power. Savonius is a simple rotor that can be used to generate power from wind on a small scale. Savonius' merits are its basic structure and ability to function at low wind speeds. This study was carried out on a Stage-ratio variation on a two-stage Savonius rotor with a Phase Shift-Angle of 30◦. The boundary condition is steady-state, and the turbulence type employed in modeling is SST. The goal of this research is to provide an optimal design for the Savonius Wind turbine as a design consideration in local-scale wind energy management, as well as to contribute to the attainment of the SDGs by 2030 through clean energy.

The extraction of vitality from the wind depends on the design of the blade. For this consideration, four blade geometries were outlined and made, the first design of the plume comprises is the straight-bladed Darrieus NACA0012, the second design is a hybrid of the straight-bladed Darrieus- horizontal vane, the third design is a hybrid of the Darrieus - vertical vane, and the fourth design is a Hybrid consisting of the straight bladed Darrieus - Savonius.

This study presents a two-dimensional numerical analysis of vortex dynamics for a hybrid VAWT. The integration of a Savonius rotor in the hybrid VAWT improves self-starting capability but introduces vortices that cause transient load fluctuations on the Darrieus blades. This study attempts to characterize the flow features around the hybrid VAWT and correlate them with the Darrieus blade force variation in one revolution. Results demonstrate the capability of numerical modeling in handling a wide range of operational conditions: the relevant position of Savonius and Darrieus blades (attachment angle γ = 0 ° − 90 ° ) and Savonius' tip speed ratio λ<inf>S</inf> (0.2-0.8, varied Savonius' rotational speed). The torque increase in the Darrieus blade in hybrid VAWT (compared to a single Darrieus rotor) due to the appearance of the vortex shedding from the advanced Savonius blade is independent of the attachment angle and tip speed ratio. Apart from start-up and power performances of the hybrid VAWT, the most rapid force fluctuation is identified when the Darrieus blade interacts with Savonius' wake at γ = 0 ° and λ S = 0.8 , which is considered undesirable. Furthermore, attachment angles of 60 ° and 90 ° exhibit better power coefficients compared to those of 0 ° and 30 ° for the hybrid VAWT. This study contributes to a comprehensive understanding of flow dynamics in hybrid VAWTs, revealing the correlation between torque variation and vortex development. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Turbomachine Blades; Vortex Flow; Wakes; Attachment Angle; Blade Vortex Interaction; Darrieus; Flow Phenomena; Powerloss; Savonius Rotor; Tip Speed Ratio; Two-dimensional; Vertical Axes Wind Turbines; Vortex Dynamics; Vertical Axis Wind Turbine","Turbomachine blades; Vortex flow; Wakes; Attachment angle; Blade vortex interaction; Darrieus; Flow Phenomena; Powerloss; Savonius rotor; Tip speed ratio; Two-dimensional; Vertical axes wind turbines; Vortex dynamics; Vertical axis wind turbine","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85181161674"

The design of this turbine needs to pay attention to several parameters, namely, the deflector angle, the number of blades, the diameter and thickness of the blades, and the diameter and thickness of the end plates. However, the problem usually encountered is imperfect turbine construction due to the large drag force that occurs so that the power generated is low.

However, a challenge arises due to its low power output because of adverse torque produced by the returning blade. The present computational study aims to address this issue by considering a modified Bach rotor design with a varying overlap ratio at a high shape factor. Additionally, the axisymmetric omnidirectional deflector (AOD) for the Bach rotor is also studied. The tip speed ratio varies from 0.4 to 1.3. The results indicate that the maximum power coefficient of 0.249 is achieved for the Bach-AOD rotor at a tip speed ratio of 1.0. The overlap ratio of 0.2 shows negative gauge pressure in the overlap region, leading to the suction of flow onto the concave part of the returning blade. The AOD configuration enhances the positive gauge pressure area on the concave side of the advancing blade. By comparing conventional semicircular rotors with the present Bach-AOD rotor, a maximum increase of 42.68% in power coefficient at a tip speed ratio of 0.4 is observed. Both the Bach-AOD configuration and Bach rotor with an overlap ratio of 0.25 achieve a relatively constant power coefficient at a tip speed ratio larger than 0.6.

In that context, hydropower energy can be one of the feasible alternatives to meet future energy demands.

Small-scale hydro-based technologies produces GHG emissions when compared to dam hydropower since they produce most of their emissions during the building and maintenance phases. Small-scale hydro-based technologies such as hydrokinetics can be considered one of the preferable options, which generate energy from flowing water. A complete review of harnessing the power from flowing water by hydrokinetic turbines (HKTs) has been carried out in this article. Information regarding the state of the art and current status of cutting-edge technology has been gathered with the working principles of hydrokinetic turbines, classifications of HKTs and their applications, the terminology used for HKTs, the dam's impact on the environment, and the selection of turbines, have been discussed thoroughly in this study.

Since the Saudi Government has announced to install 9 GW of wind power by 2032, this ambitious plan could be at least partially improved by the small wind turbines, taking into account the low annual mean wind speed on the most Kingdom of Saudi Arabia territory. However, the safety and durability of most commercially available VAWTs have not been adequately addressed with respect to the turbine over speed in high wind speed conditions. The presented research gives a methodology for calculating a cost-effective dynamic braking controller, based on a centrifugal mechanical activation spring-load mechanism with a pendulum. The analysis is focused on a small two-tier 3 kW Darrieus VAWT, where a mechanically activated friction brake is deployed as the turbine rotational speed approaches a red line. The proposed method makes a small turbine absolutely safe on any available wind speed and/or during accidental electric load switch off. The analysis was made for a typically high continental wind speed of 25 m/s. The paper presents the calculation model in VisSim software. Controller parameters were developed as the result of the research conducted on a functional turbine of the specific size in the model.

However, because of having negative torques on their returning blades, these turbines have poor power generation effectiveness. In the current research, an innovative deflector is proposed which has a cylindrical shape with bleed jets to augment the performance of dual Savonius rotors. The bleed jets are released from the narrow slots directed from the front stagnation point to the locations close to the top and bottom separation points to produce perturbations in the flow. The bleed jets interact with the boundary layer and modify the wake shear layer over the deflector.

The primary cause of low-efficiency Savonius turbines is the negative torque contribution from the returning blade. A Savonius turbine is a type of turbine characterized by its rotational direction orthogonal to the passing fluid flow and the flow interaction with advancing and returning blades, generating torque primarily through drag forces. Thus, the study proposes a novel design of a cylindrical deflector with splitters and a barrier to offset the flow field to the returning blades. This study aims to maximize the efficiency of conventional Savonius turbines using the cylindrical deflector with splitters and a barrier via a combination of computational fluid dynamics simulations and the Taguchi optimization method. The Taguchi method is used to determine the best combination of specified characteristics such as the length of the barrier (Ls/D), the barrier attachment angle (α), and the geometric shape of the cylinder deflector with a splitter and a barrier. The tip speed ratio (λ) for this study is fixed at λ = 1. The simulations and additive model revealed that the optimal combination in this study is a cylinder deflector with double wake splitters positioned at the top and middle of the deflector. The deflector is oriented parallel to the flow, and a barrier placed at the bottom of the deflector is oriented orthogonal to the flow. The optimal configuration has Ls/D ratio of 0.9 and a barrier attachment angle (α) of 10°. Therefore, the ideal combination was found to produce a power coefficient equivalent to 0.459, indicating that the performance of Savonius turbines increases by around 61% compared to previous studies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computational Fluid Dynamics; Cylinders (shapes); Drag; Vertical Axis Wind Turbine; Wind Power; Attachment Angle; Electricity-generation; Fluid-flow; Negative Torques; Rotational Directions; Savonius Turbine; Taguchi's Methods; Torque Contribution; Turbine Efficiency; Vertical Axes Wind Turbines; Taguchi Methods","Computational fluid dynamics; Cylinders (shapes); Drag; Vertical axis wind turbine; Wind power; Attachment angle; Electricity-generation; Fluid-flow; Negative torques; Rotational directions; Savonius turbine; Taguchi's methods; Torque contribution; Turbine efficiency; Vertical axes wind turbines; Taguchi methods","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175821438"

Among the various alternatives, Helical Savonius rotors have emerged as one of the most widely used technologies for small-scale hydropower generation. Numerous studies have been conducted to investigate these types of rotors, particularly to enhance their power output. Despite existing research, there is still a need for modifications and proposals for new configurations of Savonius rotors. This paper presents a numerical study of a Savonius rotor equipped with a new design of a deflector. The results indicate that the highest power coefficient achieved is 0.1247 at a tip-speed ratio of 0.7 in the absence of a deflector system. The geometric parameters of the deflector are varied to identify the configuration that generates the highest power output. With the implementation of an optimal configuration for the new deflector system, the maximum power coefficient is improved to 0.168 at a tip-speed ratio of 0.7. Otherwise, the maximum power coefficient could be enhanced by 34% compared to the same configuration without a deflector.

However, such detailed investigations for Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWT), specifically for low wind speed terrains are amply reported. This motivates us to conduct research to explore possibilities in improving performance of VAWT in low wind speed terrains, which is attempted in the present work. This is required due to the fact that most of regions do not have sufficient extractable wind energy due to low speeds. VAWTs can perform at such low wind speed, but are less efficient. Improving efficiency of VAWT will solve the purpose. Hence, the present study is aimed at finding the performance characteristics of VAWT for low Wind speed configurations. Various parameters affecting power generation are investigated. Numerical analyses on various configurations are conducted to study the effects of twist angle, free stream velocity, number of blades. Computational results obtained have been in good agreement with the established results for semi-circular Savonius rotor profile. The results suggest that for low wind speed terrains, there is a need to explore the combination of lift and drag type of profiles, which could be used for the utilization of available wind power. Hence, naturally inspired shapes (profiles) were investigated for the possible solution of combined lift and drag type wind turbines at low speeds. The blade shape for such combined lift and drag type wind turbine were deduced from the available literature. It is well established that the naturally inspired shapes as noted in sea conch follow golden ratio in its contours.

The present research work shows how a functional subsonic moist-air wind tunnel has been designed. Although this type of wind tunnel has never been developed to date, it is particularly interesting to develop a satisfactory design of feasibility under moist air conditions. Low-speed vertical-axis wind turbines employ different kinds of rotors, such as Savonius, Darrieus, and H-rotor. All these wind turbines present clear advantages, e.g., the horizontal-axis wind turbines are omnidirectional. This means they can work under different wind directions, need lower maintenance, and begin working under low wind speeds of 3 m/s. Recently, a new application of wind concentrators enabled the vertical-axis wind turbines to improve their performance coefficient based on new concepts like moist air phase change, which are being analysed to improve energy conversion. Thus, expectations were raised to design a suitable wind tunnel that accounts for the relative humidity of moist air. An initial prototype showed that the behaviour of open wind tunnels where the relative humidity of moist air was controlled by an adiabatic evaporative process was satisfactory. However, for such wind tunnels, certain improvements like computer control systems would need to be developed. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cfd; Concentrator; Experiment; Low Speed; Moist Air; Wind Energy","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174174536"

Moreover, the effect of the tunnel location through a building model is also investigated to attain the best performance and consequently the maximum power generation from the wind. The reasons behind either the degradation or improvement of the wind turbine performance are explored based on the flow behavior including pressure distribution and velocity streamlines through the building tunnel. The numerical results demonstrate the role of vortices evolution on the rotor performance. The numerical simulations presented here are validated by present measurements conducted on the wind turbine installed within a duct and in free stream conditions. The highest performance of the Savonius rotor in terms of power coefficient (C<inf>p</inf>) is reached by integrating the rotor within a building tunnel at the best tunnel location far from the center of the building, with a 104% increase in the C<inf>p</inf>, as compared to free stream wind turbine. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Building Width; Cfd; Façade Dimensions; Vortices Evolution; Wind Turbine Performance; Carbon Footprint; Computational Fluid Dynamics; Intelligent Buildings; Sustainable Development; Vortex Flow; Wind Power; Building Width; Facade Dimension; Flow Behaviours; Flow Performance; On Flow; Sustainable Building; Turbine Performance; Vortex Evolutions; Wind Turbine Performance; Wind Turbines; Alternative Energy; Building; Computational Fluid Dynamics; Performance Assessment; Wind Power; Wind Tunnel; Wind Turbine","Carbon footprint; Computational fluid dynamics; Intelligent buildings; Sustainable development; Vortex flow; Wind power; Building width; Facade dimension; Flow behaviours; Flow performance; On flow; Sustainable building; Turbine performance; Vortex evolutions; Wind turbine performance; Wind turbines; alternative energy; building; computational fluid dynamics; performance assessment; wind power; wind tunnel; wind turbine","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163823234"

The poor efficiency of this rotor is caused by the unfavorable negative torques generated as the returning blade rotates against the incoming flow. The current study aims to improve the aerodynamic performance of a Savonius wind rotor by installing a cylinder deflector with different grooved surfaces as a unique deflector system to offset the negative impact at the wake zone downstream of the deflector. The grooved surface is essentially one way to alter the surface roughness of a cylinder, which has shown to be quite successful to control vortex shedding and wake formation behind the cylinder. In contrast to previous research, a grooved surface of a cylinder deflector was used instead of traditional deflectors to increase the aerodynamic performance by disrupting the wake zone downstream of the deflector. With this motivation, a systematic parametric study via Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method was implemented for different combinations of the flow and geometric characteristics including Tip Speed Ratio (TSR) value, groove shapes (rectangular, U, and V), groove number, and size. Besides, the flow over a smooth cylinder was analyzed and compared with that of grooved cases to determine the ideal groove configurations for enhancing the total output power. The results demonstrated that the optimal deflector with the U-grooved surface augmented the aerodynamic performance the most for all TSRs. The optimal deflector has 12 U-grooved surfaces with a diameter size of 0.025 of rotor diameter. The average power coefficient enhanced dramatically up to 24.2% and 15.8% through the deflector with a U-grooved surface at TSR = 0.9 in comparison to without deflector case and smooth cylinder deflector case, respectively. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cfd; Grooved Surface; Passive Flow Control; Savonius Rotor; Wake Zone; Aerodynamics; Cylinders (shapes); Flow Control; Surface Roughness; Vertical Axis Wind Turbine; Wakes; Aero-dynamic Performance; Down-stream; Flow Control Methods; Grooved Surfaces; Passive Flow Control; Savonius Rotor; Savonius Wind Turbine; Tip Speed Ratio; Vertical Axes Wind Turbines; Wake Zones; Computational Fluid Dynamics; Aerodynamics; Computational Fluid Dynamics; Flow Control; Performance Assessment; Torque; Vortex Shedding; Wind Forcing; Wind Turbine","Aerodynamics; Cylinders (shapes); Flow control; Surface roughness; Vertical axis wind turbine; Wakes; Aero-dynamic performance; Down-stream; Flow control methods; Grooved surfaces; Passive flow control; Savonius rotor; Savonius wind turbine; Tip speed ratio; Vertical axes wind turbines; Wake zones; Computational fluid dynamics; aerodynamics; computational fluid dynamics; flow control; performance assessment; torque; vortex shedding; wind forcing; wind turbine","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163785010"

Wind and hydrokinetic energies are the most promising renewable energy resources for electric power generation to meet the growing energy demand. The vertical-axis hybrid turbine, which combines the features of good starting characteristics of the Savonius turbine and the operational efficiency of the Darrieus turbine, can serve as a viable option for power generation. A variety of configurations of the hybrid turbine are possible based on several design parameters such as the relative position of the Darrieus and Savonius rotors, overlap ratio, solidity ratio, blade or buckets shape and radius ratio, attachment angle and others. To some extent, the influence of these parameters on the hybrid turbine performance has been investigated through experimental and numerical studies by considering a number of physical and computational models. In most of the findings, the range of maximum power coefficient values is recorded between 0.08 and 0.51. Though individual vertical axis turbines have been widely studied and reviewed, similar review papers on hybrid turbines are scarce.

Its advantages attract world attention due to its simple geometry design and significantly cheaper to build compared to a horizontal axis wind turbine (HAWT). The present study will consider the essential geometry improvement of the Savonius rotor, where the profile of the blade was made in the form of a half-cylinder. Numerical simulation was conducted to study the effect of geometrical setup on the performance of the rotor in terms of the coefficient of power, coefficient of torque and power output. The model was designed according to the existing tested model by experimental work, except for the inner surface blade which uses an overlap ratio of 0.2. Different wind speeds of 6 m/s, 8 m/s and 10 m/s were used for the simulation to analyze the behaviour of properties of the new design blade. According to the results obtained, it shows that the power coefficient for the new design of the inner blade was increased by 20% compared to the previous design. The power output of the wind turbine reaches the maximum power in the middle of the tip speed ratio for all types of wind speeds. This is because the power coefficient will start to fall off after reaching the maximum electrical power produced. Besides, it is due to the limit of the blade performance which will keep the blade from rotating too fast and avoiding damage due to excessive force. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","M Power Coefficient; Renewable Energy; Savonius Wind Turbine; Vertical Axis; Wind Energy","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174002885"

Experimenting to improve its performance is a difficult task because it is costly, time demanding, and complicated. CFD simulation with numerical prediction could be a good alternative. A novel change is introduced in this paper of two counter rotating Savonius wind turbines to enhance their efficiency. The suggested change includes curtain configurations as well as the insertion of fin to the blade. A CFD simulation was used to predict the effect of the proposed adjustments employing ‘ANSYS FLUENT 16′. To avoid the opposing torque to each rotor rotation, the curtain arrangements were placed in front of both rotors. The fin was adopted to take advantage of the available area in the blade for directing wind flow. The performance of the rotor when fitted with various curtain arrangements, both with and without fin, was predicted and compared to that of the conventional CRSWT. The goal of these comparisons was to improve the geometrical data of the suggested curtain arrangements as well as to investigate the influence of fin addition on the blade. With the curtain arrangement having maximum curtain blade lengths (500 mm, 550 mm) and maximum angles (50°, 30°) and the addition of only one fin, the CRSWT's maximum power coefficient increased by nearly 48 percent. The simulation findings revealed that by selecting the right curtain arrangement and adding fins to the blade, the performance of the CRSWT could be greatly improved. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cfd Simulation; Curtaining; Savonius Turbines; Vawt; Wind Energy; Computational Fluid Dynamics; Fins (heat Exchange); Turbine Components; Turbomachine Blades; Vertical Axis Wind Turbine; Cfd Simulations; Counter Rotating; Curtaining; Low Wind Conditions; Numerical Investigations; Performance; Savonius Turbine; Savonius Wind Turbine; Turbine Performance; Vertical Axes Wind Turbines; Wind Power","Computational fluid dynamics; Fins (heat exchange); Turbine components; Turbomachine blades; Vertical axis wind turbine; CFD simulations; Counter rotating; Curtaining; Low wind conditions; Numerical investigations; Performance; Savonius turbine; Savonius wind turbine; Turbine performance; Vertical axes wind turbines; Wind power","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163391973"

This study proposes a novel technique to calculate the optimal turbine tip speed ratio (TSR) with a cost-effective and user-friendly moment balancing algorithm. A reliable dynamic TSR matrix was developed with varying rotational speeds and fluid velocities, unlike previous works simulated at a fixed fluid velocity. Thrust and idle moments are introduced as functions of inlet fluid velocity and rotational speed, respectively. The quadratic relationships are verified through regression analysis, and net moment equations are established. Rotational speed was a reliable predictor for Pinwheel’s idle moment, while inlet velocity was a reliable predictor for thrust moment for both models. The optimal (C<inf>p</inf>, TSR) values for Pinwheel and Savonius turbines were (0.223, 2.37) and (0.63, 0.29), respectively, within an acceptable error range for experimental validation.

The series of computational and physical experiments for Darrieus rotors with varied numbers and shapes of blades were performed. The detailed visualization of the flow was presented. The turbulent flows surrounding the Darrieus and Savonius rotors were studied, and as a part of these investigations, the major phases of vortex progress were identified.

Out of many kinds of wind turbines, a lot of in-depth studies have been conducted to improve the performance of the drag-based vertical-axis wind turbine called Savonius rotor. This kind of vertical-axis wind turbine usually suffers from poor energy conversion efficiency, particularly for its conventional shape (thin half-cylinders). In the current work, a bionic blade shape of the Savonius-type wind turbine rotor inspired by sandeels (also called sandlances) is proposed, combined with an optimization step in order to maximize performance. Sandeels are slim elongated fish that often swim in vast shoals. The bionic blade is described by two principal geometrical parameters, both divided by the blade length (d); the maximum blade camber (f<inf>max</inf>) and its location (X<inf>f<inf>max</inf></inf>). The optimization relies on evolutionary algorithms to maximize the average power coefficient of the Savonius rotor with sandeel-inspired blades when varying the two design parameters. A total of 128 individuals have been evaluated numerically using a series of two-dimensional transient simulations with the software Star-CCM+. In comparison to the conventional rotor with two arc-type semi-circular blades, the optimal design with sandeel-inspired blades exhibits a considerable increase in turbine efficiency of up to 9.21% at the design tip speed ratio (λ = 0.8). Investigating the performance over the entire operating range results in a maximum power coefficient of 0.255 by the optimal rotor, leading to a gain of about 10.58% with respect to the standard rotor at λ=1. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aerodynamics; Biomimicry; Cfd-based Optimization; Savonius Rotor; Vertical-axis Wind Turbine; Biomimetics; Computational Fluid Dynamics; Energy Conversion Efficiency; Geometry; Kinetic Energy; Kinetics; Optimization; Turbine Components; Turbomachine Blades; Vertical Axis Wind Turbine; Biomimicry; Bionic Blade; Cfd Based Optimizations; Energy; Evolutionary Optimizations; Optimisations; Performance; Power Coefficients; Savonius Rotor; Vertical Axes Wind Turbines; Aerodynamics; Aerodynamics; Computational Fluid Dynamics; Kinetic Energy; Numerical Model; Optimization; Wind Turbine","Biomimetics; Computational fluid dynamics; Energy conversion efficiency; Geometry; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Optimization; Turbine components; Turbomachine blades; Vertical axis wind turbine; Biomimicry; Bionic blade; CFD based optimizations; Energy; Evolutionary optimizations; Optimisations; Performance; Power coefficients; Savonius rotor; Vertical axes wind turbines; Aerodynamics; aerodynamics; computational fluid dynamics; kinetic energy; numerical model; optimization; wind turbine","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85152688956"

A Savonius wind turbine is a drag-based vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT) that is known to have low noise levels and good starting characteristics even at low wind speeds. Its disadvantage lies in its low efficiency or low coefficient of performance. Exploring ways to increase the coefficient of performance, numerical investigations were carried out on different modified Savonius VAWT configurations, having different curvatures, different overlap percentages, added mini blades, and fitted out with extended surfaces. These investigations were computationally executed on Ansys Fluent™ using the sliding mesh technique. Two-dimensional simulations, on a Bach blade curvature with zero overlap as well as a half-circle and a polynomial curvature with overlap, showed that for a wind speed of 5 m/s and a tip speed ratio of 0.8, the half-circle blade curvature having an overlap of 20% performs best, yielding the highest net (average) coefficient of moment, equal to 0.3065. Results also show that the addition of mini blades to this optimal configuration produces a slight improvement in the coefficient of moment. However, the addition of extended surfaces onto the blades caused the minimum coefficient of moment to be a substantial negative value and thus resulting in a much lower value for the turbine's average coefficient of moment. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Coefﬁcient Of Moment; Coefﬁcient Of Performance; Curvature; Extended Surfaces; Mini Blades; Overlap; Savonius Rotor; Wind Turbine","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160669376"

This paper aims to design two type-2 fuzzy logic controllers in the demand-side energy management system. For this purpose, a combination of renewable energy sources, such as fuel cells, photovoltaic solar panels, vertical axis wind turbines with a helical savonius rotor, and an electric vehicle and energy storage system along with an external grid are utilized to supply the electricity usage of home appliances in a smart home. By using the proposed method, higher quality, more economical, and environmentally friendly energy can be accomplished.

Vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT) of Savonius type is advantageous in places of small-scale power production and low wind speed regions. It is a VAWT of the drag-based type. The disadvantage of a Savonius rotor is its low efficiency due to the generation of negative torque on the returning blade. To reduce the negative torque, the performance parameters of a Savonius rotor need to be optimized. The shear-stress transport variant of k-ω turbulence model is used in the current study to compute 2D unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes calculations for an ellipse shape blade Savonius rotor to capture its aerodynamic behavior. The flow complexities, such as vortex generation and circulation, are analyzed for four different azimuthal angles 0 deg, 45 deg, 90 deg, and 135 deg for a tip speed ratio (TSR) of 0.8.

In contrast, low wind conditions—which are typically present in dense urban areas—are found to favour vertical axis wind turbines (VAWT). These turbines have a simple design, are inexpensive and quiet, and are discovered to be better in low wind situations. In this research, we have chosen wind tree applications to absorb the most available wind energy. The new Aeroleaf Savonius Wind Turbine was developed numerically and a computational fluid dynamics simulation was performed on this new type of Savonius tree to predict its performance.

The rotor speed increased by 10.4% from 5.5 to 6.3 m/s wind speed at 0.45 tip speed ratio.

The optimum ANN architecture demonstrates R ≈ 0.96 and 0.98 for the testing and training datasets, respectively. Further, in the quest of finding the optimum performance from the entire power curve of the rotor, the Golden Section Method (GSM) is linked with the trained ANN model. Using these soft computing techniques, a parametric study is carried out to understand the dependency of rotor performance on their design and operating parameters. At the end, a graphical interface is developed as a product so as to allow the user to predict the performance of the new rotor designs intuitively. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Neural Network; Data-driven Engineering; Golden Section Method; Machine Learning For Engineering Applications; Parametric Modeling; Savonius Wind Rotor; Machine Learning; Matlab; Soft Computing; Data Driven; Data-driven Engineering; Engineering Applications; Golden Section Method; Machine Learning For Engineering Application; Machine-learning; Optimum Performance; Parametric Models; Savonius Wind Rotor; Vertical Axis; Neural Networks","Machine learning; MATLAB; Soft computing; Data driven; Data-driven engineering; Engineering applications; Golden section method; Machine learning for engineering application; Machine-learning; Optimum performance; Parametric models; Savonius wind rotor; Vertical axis; Neural networks","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143966398"

Few studies have been carried out on the hybrid HKT having a straight-bladed Savonius rotor in order to enhance the performance of the rotor. However, there is a scope to investigate the effect of radius ratio, attachment angle and water flow velocity on the average power coefficient of a hybrid HKT having a helical-bladed Savonius rotor. Under the present study, the effect of radius ratio, attachment angle and water flow velocity has been analysed numerically on a configuration of a hybrid HKT comprised of three Darrieus rotor blades and two Savonius helical blades. The simulations on different configurations of the hybrid HKT are performed using ANSYS v15. It is observed that the radius ratio and attachment angle significantly affect the energy harnessing capability (average power coefficient) of the hybrid HKT. The optimum radius ratio and attachment angle values for the best-configured hybrid HKT are 0.4 and 90°, respectively. The maximum average power coefficient of the hybrid HKT model with a radius ratio of 0.4 is enhanced by 46.2%, 27.6% and 5.2% compared to models with a radius ratio of 0.2, 0.8 and 0.6, respectively. The hybrid HKT with an attachment angle of 90° is found 4.3% and 4.8%, more efficient than the hybrid configurations with attachment angles of 30° and 150°, respectively. It has been observed that the hybrid HKT is found to have better efficient for low values of water flow velocity. Further, a significant effect of the Savonius blade profile is also found on the performance of the hybrid hydrokinetic turbine rotor. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Attachment Angle; Average Power Coefficient; Flow Visualization; Hybrid Rotor; Radius Ratio; Flow Of Water; Hydraulics; Kinetic Energy; Kinetics; Turbine Components; Turbomachine Blades; Attachment Angle; Average Power; Average Power Coefficient; Flow Visualisation; Hybrid Rotor; Hydrokinetic Turbines; Performance; Power Coefficients; Radii Ratio; Water Flows; Flow Velocity; Flow Velocity; Kinetic Energy; Performance Assessment; Turbine; Water Flow","Flow of water; Hydraulics; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Turbine components; Turbomachine blades; Attachment angle; Average power; Average power coefficient; Flow visualisation; Hybrid rotor; Hydrokinetic turbines; Performance; Power coefficients; Radii ratio; Water flows; Flow velocity; flow velocity; kinetic energy; performance assessment; turbine; water flow","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145298670"

In order to evaluate the effect of each parameter, the rotor’s power coefficient (Cp) for different tip speed ratio (TSR) values and overall torque as a function of the azimuth angle are investigated. The results show that the generated power of a solid rotor with more buckets is less than that of the two-bladed rotor, and by decreasing the overlap ratio and spacing size, Cp values are enhanced. Moreover, a rotor with a larger bucket arc angle has less Cp value and total torque, in addition to shape factor, which changes the configuration of the rotor by adding arms, thus enhancing the aerodynamic performance of the prototype. Furthermore, it is shown that installing a curtain in the upstream section of the rotor improves Cp value by directing airflow. Moreover, it is observed that by increasing inlet wind velocity and, subsequently, the Reynolds number, generated power is boosted. In addition, it is noted that a suitable multi-bucket rotor configuration can boost generated power. Finally, the optimum design is achieved by using the Kriging method. Based on the optimization results, a 2-bladed Savonius VAWT with an overlap ratio of 0, spacing size of 0 (m), arc angle of 170°, shape factor of 0.5, and inlet wind velocity of 12 (m/s) at TSR = 0.37 introduces the highest efficiency. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cfd Simulation; Power Coefficient; Savonius Wind Turbine; Tip Speed Ratio; Torque Coefficient; Vertical Axis Wind Turbine; Aerodynamics; Azimuth; Computational Fluid Dynamics; Optimization; Simulation; Wind Turbine; Iran","aerodynamics; azimuth; computational fluid dynamics; optimization; simulation; wind turbine; Iran","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165701256"

There are many ways to improve power performance, including the use of multiple-stage turbines. Although many studies have investigated the effects of multi-staging, few have captured their effect on three performance parameters combined: power efficiency, flow structure, and self-starting capability. Therefore, the current study explored and analyzed the extent of these parameters using a multi-stage conventional Savonius turbine in a wind tunnel facility with a varying flow speed of 5 m/s to 9 m/s. The findings suggested that adding a stage increased the power coefficient to a maximum of 138% at 5 m/s, but reached a plateau as the wind speed increased to 9 m/s. The double-stage was discovered to reduce the self-starting speed of the turbine at all rotor angles for self-starting capabilities. The coefficient of static torque results indicated that the maximum static torque for the single and double-stage configurations occurred at 45° and 45°/135° rotor angles, respectively. The qualitative study revealed that the double-stage turbine has a larger wake size at higher wind speeds, resulting in a reduced wake intensity at the rear side of the rotor. The reduced torque variation caused by the additional stage has improved the overall performance of the turbine, making the double-stage configuration more preferable than the single-stage, particularly for low speed, high depth, and narrow river applications. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Flow Visualization; Multi-stage; Power Coefficient; Savonius Turbine; Self-start; Rural Areas; Turbines; Wind; Wind Tunnels; Double Stage; Double-stage Configuration; Flow Visualisation; Multi-stages; Power Coefficients; Rotor Angle; Savonius Turbine; Self Starts; Self-starting; Single Stage; Wakes","Rural areas; Turbines; Wind; Wind tunnels; Double stage; Double-stage configuration; Flow visualisation; Multi-stages; Power coefficients; Rotor angle; Savonius turbine; Self starts; Self-starting; Single stage; Wakes","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144495422"

Wind turbines produce electricity from the wind power to drive the electric generators. There are two types of Wind turbines depending on the axis of rotation with the respect to the ground, Horizontal axis wind turbines (HAWT) and Vertical axis wind turbines (VAWT). In urban areas, due to the space compatibility and skewed wind conditions, VAWT are preferred. There are two types of VAWT, lift-type configuration like Darrieus wind turbine and drag-type configuration like Savonius wind turbines. Due to factors like self-starting capabilities and better performance even in low-speed winds, Savonius wind turbines are preferred. The present paper, Effect of Overlap Ratio on the blade performance are investigated and analysed. For this, the diameter of the rotor is maintained. Two dimensional numerical simulations are performed using RANS equations and sliding-mesh method. The turbulence model employed is SST k- ω model. Change in the RPM due to overlap distance at various inlet wind speeds were analysed and compared.

To achieve a higher Cp, wind tunnel tests with wind speeds ranging from 4 m/s to 10 m/s were performed. In the present study, the rotational speed under the clockwise rotor houses arrangement that was demonstrated under condition monitoring at previous study was experimentally compared with the rotor height of 0.1 m, rotor diameter of 0.44 m, and H/D=0.227. The use of four-bladed NESP-QCRH was found to increase Cp with 0.126 at 5 m/s and a 306.5% higher value than NESP-NO QCRH. The higher wind speed of 10 m/s had no impact on the enhancement of Cp for NESPQCRH when turbulent caused vortice flow that increased the blockage effect between returning blade, advancing blade, and QCRH. Despite this, it was discovered that using a mild steel shaft and rotor hub had a Cp of 0.126 at 5 m/s, a 35.5% advantage over using an aluminum shaft-rotor hub, which had a Cp of 0.093. The four blades with a mild steel hub-shaft (MS-4B-CFRP) has Cp from 14.8 to 36.1% over ALU-4B-CFRP and 128.2% to 260% of Cp over 2 blades rotor of NESP with QCRH. The improvement between 14.8% to 35.5% of Cp proved that the closed center type of modified SWT for NESP-QCRH with MS-4B-CFRP became the best rotor design due to the inertia effect from the extra mass of 720g of mild steel hub-shaft (MS-4B-CFRP) over aluminum type (ALU-4B-CFRP). © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Condition Monitoring; Ellipse Shape Profile; Pillow Block Bearing; Quarter Cylindrical Rotor House; Rotational Speed; Savonius Wind Turbine; Wind Tunnel; Aluminum; Condition Monitoring; Geometry; Houses; Low Carbon Steel; Wind Speed; Wind Turbines; A: Mild Steels; Ellipse Shape Profile; Performance; Pillow Block Bearing; Quarter Cylindrical Rotor House; Rotational Speed; Rotor Hubs; Savonius Wind Turbine; Shaft Material; Wind Tunnel Tests; Wind Tunnels","Aluminum; Condition monitoring; Geometry; Houses; Low carbon steel; Wind speed; Wind turbines; A: mild steels; Ellipse shape profile; Performance; Pillow block bearing; Quarter cylindrical rotor house; Rotational speed; Rotor hubs; Savonius wind turbine; Shaft material; Wind tunnel tests; Wind tunnels","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85197733947"

Although it exhibits a lower performance, this type of rotor is gaining immense interest in the research community because of its straightforward design, self-starting capability, and operational ease. Over the past two decades, numerous blade profiles have been created to improve the performance of this rotor. A recently developed arc-elliptical blade profile has shown an improved performance characteristic. In the present computational study, this arc-elliptical blade profile is considered with a concentrated augmenter placed in front of it. The concentrated augmenter is placed to enhance the performance of the blade profile further. The arc-elliptical blade profile with the concentrated augmenter is investigated using a commercial computational fluid dynamic solver ANSYS Fluent 17.1 with the help of shear stress transport (SST) κ-ω turbulence model.

Savonius wind turbines on the other hand are capable of providing relatively high self-starting capabilities but have a lower power coefficient. The objective of the present study is thus to develop a modified design of a combined Darrieus-Savonius wind turbine in order to improve its self-starting capability and power coefficient. The modified combined design consists of helical-bladed Darrieus and Savonius rotors with helical angles of 90 and 45 degrees, respectively. The influences of various diameter ratios in addition to various attaching angles between Darrieus and Savonius rotors in the proposed design are numerically investigated. The Reynolds-Average Navier-Stokes equations in three dimensions along with the turbulence model of k-ω (SST) are developed and numerically simulated. The predicted results are validated using the available measurements. Thus, numerical predictions of the variations of the coefficient of power versus tip speed ratio as well as the coefficient of torque over a whole cycle can be made. As part of the evaluation of the starting characteristics of the proposed configurations, the static torque coefficient during a complete revolution is also calculated. Based on the current study, some significant findings can be derived. The coefficient of power remarkably increases with rising the diameter ratio up to an optimal value of 0.45, then a significant reduction in coefficient of power is observed with further increment of diameter ratio beyond 0.45 due to increasing the drag losses by Savonius rotor. In comparison to a solo Darrieus rotor at the same dimensions, the combined turbine with the best design parameters achieved a peak coefficient of power of 0.386 with a performance gain of about 19 %. Furthermore, the combined design significantly reduces the fluctuations of coefficient of static torque in addition to achieving a higher average coefficient of static torque with positive values at all azimuth angles compared to solo Darrieus rotor. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Attaching Angle; Combined Turbine; Diameter Ratio; Helical Blades; Performance Enhancement; Drag; Navier Stokes Equations; Torque; Turbine Components; Turbomachine Blades; Wind Turbines; Attaching Angle; Coefficient Of Power; Combined Turbine; Darrieus Rotors; Diameter Ratio; Helical Blades; Performance Enhancements; Power Coefficients; Savonius Wind Turbine; Self-starting; Turbulence Models","Drag; Navier Stokes equations; Torque; Turbine components; Turbomachine blades; Wind turbines; Attaching angle; Coefficient of power; Combined turbine; Darrieus rotors; Diameter ratio; Helical blades; Performance enhancements; Power coefficients; Savonius wind turbine; Self-starting; Turbulence models","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185541818"

The use of renewable sources of energy for power generation has become important now than ever to mitigate the effects of global warning. Wind energy is one such alternative. It is clean, non-emitting, sustainable and environmentally friendly. In the present work, the performance of a Savonius rotor for wind energy application is studied experimentally and numerically. Three different rotor configurations having blade arc angles of 65°, 110° and 148° were tested in a wind tunnel. The rotor with blade arc angle of 110° performed the best. The peak power outputs for the 65°, 110° and 148° configurations are 0.05 W, 0.15 W and 0.11 W respectively. The 110° rotor model was later used to study the effect of deflector plate on the rotor performance. The best deflector plate position is γ = 0.3 at an exposure ratio of 0.6. At this configuration, the power coefficient is 0.06 compared to 0.021 recorded for the 110° model without deflector plate. Finally, the flow characteristics are studied in detail using commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code ANSYS-CFX. The presence of the deflector plate shielded the returning plate from the approaching flow, hence reducing the negative torque and directed the flow onto the advancing blade. The combination of these two improved the performance of the Savonius rotor. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Coefficient Of Power; Computational Fluid Dynamics (cfd); Deflector Plate; Savonius Rotor; Wind Tunnel Testing; Fossil Fuels; Global Warming; Wind Power; Wind Tunnels; Coefficient Of Power; Computational Fluid Dynamic; Deflector Plate; Energy Demands; Performance; Power- Generations; Renewable Sources; Savonius Rotor; Sources Of Energy; Wind-tunnel Testing; Computational Fluid Dynamics","Fossil fuels; Global warming; Wind power; Wind tunnels; Coefficient of power; Computational fluid dynamic; Deflector plate; Energy demands; Performance; Power- generations; Renewable sources; Savonius rotor; Sources of energy; Wind-tunnel testing; Computational fluid dynamics","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185541794"

Vertical axis wind turbine clusters suitable for urban architecture integration are part of the market where not only the performance parameters are of utmost importance, but also their aesthetic design, low noise, and low-cost operation. Starting from the 3D geometry of a tree-type Savonius vertical axis wind turbine cluster with 27 rotors, a 2D computational domain is extracted including 9 turbines. The aerodynamic influence of the array pattern is numerically evaluated with Ansys Fluent URANS simulations. Vorticity magnitude contours together with torque and power plots for each rotor are thoroughly analyzed. The rotor position in the array along with the operating regime in terms of TSR, prove to be responsible for the power extraction capability of each turbine. While the output power of 4 out of 9 rotors belongs to the 130-140 W range for TSR 0.7 to 1, one rotor reaches 200 W in the high TSR regimes due to positive field effects. In contrast, detrimental coupling with the neighbouring turbines is encountered by 2 rotors resulting in low power output figures below 50 W in the low TSR regimes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cluster Coupling Effects; Computational Fluid Dynamics; Power; Renewable Energy; Savonius; Urban Environment; Vertical Axis Wind Turbine; Wind Energy System; Wind Turbines Cluster; Aerodynamics; Computational Geometry; Energy Harvesting; Vertical Axis Wind Turbine; Wind Power; Cluster Configurations; Cluster Coupling Effect; Coupling Effect; Power; Renewable Energies; Savonii; Urban Environments; Vertical Axes Wind Turbines; Wind Energy Systems; Wind Turbine Cluster; Computational Fluid Dynamics","Aerodynamics; Computational geometry; Energy harvesting; Vertical axis wind turbine; Wind power; Cluster configurations; Cluster coupling effect; Coupling effect; Power; Renewable energies; Savonii; Urban environments; Vertical axes wind turbines; Wind energy systems; Wind turbine cluster; Computational fluid dynamics","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182741804"

However, the main problem is the negative torque on the rotary blades. This paper used computational fluid dynamics to numerically investigate the two-dimensional flow analysis of a modified elliptical Savonius wind turbine. This study investigated and compared five rotor blades: Classic, elliptical, and their three modifications. The behavior of wind energy was studied explicitly by changing the angle of the axis of the elliptical blade from the concave side, which leads to a convex shape to increase the area affected by the thrust force and increase the positive torque. The ANSYS (previously known as STASYS Structural Analysis System) Fluent version 15 software solves the unstable Reynolds-Naiver-Stokes (URAN) equation. The coupling algorithm solves the pressure-based coupling pressure velocity using the ANSYS Fluent. In the simulation, the drag, lift, and moment coefficients on the Savonius turbine were calculated directly at each change in the axis angle. The test results at wind speeds of up to nine m/s showed that the modified elliptical turbine with an axis angle of 50° had the highest coefficient power (Cp) among other elliptical blade modifications. In comparison, the test results with variations in wind speeds of 4–12 m/s showed that turbines with an axis angle of 55° performed better with a higher tip speed ratio (TSR) than other models. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blade Angle; Computational Fluid; Power Coefficient; Wind Energy; Aerodynamics; Computational Fluid Dynamics; Drag; Turbine Components; Turbomachine Blades; Wind Power; Wind Speed; Aero-dynamic Performance; Blade Angle; Computational Fluid; Ellipticals; Fluents; Numerical Investigations; Power Coefficients; Savonius Turbine; Vertical Axes Wind Turbines; Vertical Axis Wind Turbine","Aerodynamics; Computational fluid dynamics; Drag; Turbine components; Turbomachine blades; Wind power; Wind speed; Aero-dynamic performance; Blade angle; Computational fluid; Ellipticals; Fluents; Numerical investigations; Power coefficients; Savonius turbine; Vertical axes wind turbines; Vertical axis wind turbine","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182319954"

This study evaluates the potential installation of a simple 2-bladed SWT on Queen Alya’ airport highway, Amman, Jordan. The strategic objective of this work was to design and install the SWT prototype at different sites along the airport road to define the most efficient location for capturing wind energy. The SWT rotor was fabricated via galvanized steel sheets. The self-starting ability of the rotor was examined by determining the torque coefficient at different angles of attack. The field tests were carried out by employing the turbine at three different locations along a six-lane highway (including the left, right, and middle sides of the highway). It was found that the proposed turbine has a cut-in wind speed of 2.5 m/s. Furthermore, the torque coefficient values indicated that the proposed rotor has a strong self-starting capacity. Field studies also revealed that the rotational speed of the turbine differs at various positions of the wind turbine. In addition, the results highlighted the significance of wind directions relative to vehicle directions for generating wind power on highways. The established Savonius rotor exhibited a maximum coefficient of performance of 0.25 with operational TSRs up to 0.7.

Among other variants of the vertical-axis wind rotors, the Savonius rotor has become an attractive candidate as a small-scale stand-alone system due to its direction independency, ease of fabrication and the absence of yaw-mechanism. The present paper attempts to study the effect of corrugated blades on the performance of a conventional Savonius rotor. The corrugation is a bio-inspired concept derived from the dragonfly wings. As reported in literature, the corrugation applied in the chord-wise direction of the airfoil improves the lift characteristics. This lift improvement is caused by the trapped vortices inside the corrugation that promotes a low-pressure region over the leading edge and suction surface of the airfoil. This concept of corrugation and its effect has been applied to the blades of a conventional Savonius wind rotor to improve its torque characteristics. In this paper, a rotor with corrugated semicircular blade profiles is studied by two-dimensional (2D) transient numerical simulation in ANSYS FLUENT using shear stress transport (SST) k-ω turbulence model. The simulations are conducted in the range of 5 m/s to 7 m/s to suit the lower wind velocities of the Savonius rotor. The torque and power coefficients of the corrugated semicircular-bladed rotor are calculated at the rotating conditions. Further, the pressure and local torque distributions over the corrugated blade surfaces are obtained and analyzed to understand the torque mechanism of the rotor with corrugated blade profiles. In order to have a direct comparison, the study has also been carried out for semicircular-bladed rotor without corrugation. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bio-inspired Blade; Computational Fluid Dynamics; Power Coefficient; Reynolds Number; Savonius Rotor; Airfoils; Biomimetics; Computational Fluid Dynamics; Shear Stress; Torque; Turbulence Models; Vortex Flow; Wind Power; Bio-inspired Blade; Blade Profile; Bladed Rotors; Computational Analysis; Low Velocity Region; Power Coefficients; Reynold Number; Savonius Rotor; Savonius Wind Rotor; Vertical Axis Wind Rotors; Reynolds Number","Airfoils; Biomimetics; Computational fluid dynamics; Shear stress; Torque; Turbulence models; Vortex flow; Wind power; Bio-inspired blade; Blade profile; Bladed rotors; Computational analysis; Low velocity region; Power coefficients; Reynold number; Savonius rotor; Savonius wind rotor; Vertical axis wind rotors; Reynolds number","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177450480"

Savonius has a very large torque and requires a low wind velocity to start the rotation, but the efficiency is below 20%. Meanwhile, Darrieus is not capable of self-starting if the wind velocity is below 4 m/s, but the efficiency is the best among all types of vertical axis wind turbines, which is around 40-45%. So far, many researchers have applied the hybrid Savonius-Darrieus to combine their performances. However, the conventional hybrid Savonius-Darrieus cannot produce an optimal Power Coefficient at a high Tip Speed Ratio. In this study, an improvement in the performance of the hybrid Savonius-Darrieus has been analyzed using the Computational Fluid Dynamics method at various fluid flows. This improvement was carried out with the aim of obtaining a high Moment Coefficient and Power Coefficient in all turbine Tip Speed Ratios compared to the conventional hybrid Savonius-Darrieus. The hybrid model used is the 2-bladed Savonius as the internal rotor and the 3-bladed Darrieus NREL S809 as the external rotor with a rotor radius ratio of 0.5. Improvements were made by changing the turbine rotation mode from hybrid at a low Tip Speed Ratio to single Darrieus at a high Tip Speed Ratio. This method was tested in the wind velocity range of 3-7 m/s using the Realizable k-e turbulence model, enhanced wall treatment.

Based on the aforementioned merits, it is decided to conduct a performance improvement task by developing a novel blade shape bio-inspired from the polyp leaf of the orange sea-pen (Ptilosarcus gurneyi). The similarities between flow physics of the Savonius rotor and the feeding mechanism of the sea-pen are discussed. The procedure of shape extraction for novel blade is narrated and the rotors are fabricated.

Using wind energy as one type of renewable energies, would contribute to reduce the global warming. In countries such as Malaysia where the average annual wind speed is 2-2.5 m/s using wind energy is a challenge because of the low wind speed. However, using a hybrid Savonius-Darrieus vertical axis wind turbine in low wind speed areas, the performance of the wind turbine may increase, and the starting rotation speed will decrease. This research aims at a comprehensive study on a hybrid Savonius-Darrieus wind turbine with helical Savonius rotor combined with helical and straight bladed Darrieus rotor. In this research, a base model with the name of Model Base was generated and two models with new configurations were generated in SOLIDWORKS. A numerical studies and simulation were conducted on these three designs using Ansys Fluent to identify the more suitable combination for low wind speed areas. Based on the obtained result hybrid Savonius-Darrieus with helical Savonius rotor and helical Darrieus rotor were found to be the most suitable combination because of their stable aerodynamic performance throughout a full rotation.

However, the major drawback of such a turbine is its relatively low efficiency. In this framework, this study aims at assessing the various design parameters (number of blades, height-to-diameter ratio, and overlap ratio) of a Savonius wind turbine in an attempt to increase its efficiency.

The study results have demonstrated that the hybrid rotor yields an exceptional increment of about 159.41% in the torque coefficient under low tip speed ratio (TSR) regimes (during initial starting) compared to the Darrieus rotor. However, due to the Savonius rotor’s presence, the hybrid rotor’s maximum power coefficient is reduced slightly compared to the maximum operating point of the Darrieus rotor. Further, the hybrid rotor yields a wider operating range than the single maximum operating point by the Darrieus rotor.

The most widely used wind power harvesters are those where the working element rotates (a propeller or a vertical axis turbine, such as a Darrieus or Savonius rotor). However, the possibility of using the flow-induced oscillations of elastic structures in order to generate energy is now actively considered. One of the types of such oscillations is galloping, i.e. vibrations of bluff bodies in the direction perpendicular to the incident flow. The occurrence of galloping is due to the fact that aerodynamic forces acting on a bluff body, under certain conditions, create a negative damping. In this paper, we consider a mechanical system consisting of three bodies that can move in a direction perpendicular to the flow. One of these bodies is a square prism, and the other two are material points. The bodies are connected in series with each other and with a fixed support by linear elastic springs. A permanent magnet is rigidly connected to the prism. This magnet moves inside an induction coil. As a result, an electric current is generated in the electrical circuit connected to the coil. For such installations, on the one hand, it is required that galloping occurs at the lowest possible flow speed. On the other hand, at high flow speeds, it is necessary to reduce the amplitude of oscillations so that the device would not be damaged. The influence of the system parameters (in particular, the spring stiffness coefficients) on the stability of the equilibrium and on the characteristics of periodic solutions is studied. It is shown that by changing the stiffness of the springs, it is possible to significantly expand the range of flow speeds where the galloping occurs. The amplitudes of oscillations of bodies increase as the flow speed grows. In order to increase the limit flow speed, at which the amplitudes of oscillations start exceeding the maximum permissible value, a regulating algorithm is proposed. Within the framework of this algorithm, the displacement of one of mass points with respect to the prism is locked/unlocked depending on the current flow speed. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Galloping; Oscillations; Periodic Solution; Wind Power Harvester","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147342808"

The research shows that the operating rotor significantly modifies the flow on the downwind part of the rotor and in the wake, but the impact of the tip speed ratio on the average velocity distribution is small.

The accuracy and efficiency of simulation methods are critical for the reliable design of Savonius rotors. Among various approaches, VPM is chosen because it can be flexibly incorporated with self-correction techniques, and the distribution of bound vortex particles can effectively represent complex geometries. In this work, a double-trailing-edge-wake-modeling vortex particle method (DTVPM) is presented to extend the working range of VPM for dealing with large rotating amplitudes and high tip speed ratios (TSRs). DTVPM addresses asymmetrical torque predictions for a Savonius rotor without gap width. However, DTVPM performs poorly at high TSRs due to the absence of viscous effects near the surface. To capture complex wake structures, such as reverse flow structures, the viscous correction for tip vortices is suggested. The current research focuses on the implementation and validation of DTVPM for predicting torque coefficients and wake patterns, as well as comparisons to OpenFOAM results. Two-dimensional and incompressible flow is estimated at (Formula presented.) = 0.2–1.2. For the studied cases, a maximum power coefficient is obtained at (Formula presented.), consistent with published experimental data. In addition, the process of trailing-edge vortices generation and detachment is captured by DTVPM. The comparison results between OpenFOAM and DTVPM show that DTVPM allows to efficiently simulate a Savonius rotor without any empirical parameters. DTVPM will help to improve existing engineering models for wind energy fields. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Double-trailing-edge-wake-modeling; Flow Characteristics; Power Performances; Savonius Rotor; Vortex Particle Method; Incompressible Flow; Vortex Flow; Wakes; Double-trailing-edge-wake-modeling; Flow Characteristic; Performance Characteristics; Power Flows; Power Performance; Savonius Rotor; Tip Speed Ratio; Trailing Edges; Vortex Particle Method; Wake Model; Wind Power; Flow Measurement; Incompressible Flow; Torque; Vortex","Incompressible flow; Vortex flow; Wakes; Double-trailing-edge-wake-modeling; Flow characteristic; Performance characteristics; Power flows; Power performance; Savonius rotor; Tip speed ratio; Trailing edges; Vortex particle method; Wake model; Wind power; flow measurement; incompressible flow; torque; vortex","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142285364"

However, they suffer drawbacks due to the negative torques on their returning blades. We propose a novel solution by dynamically venting out these returning blades using controllable flaps, which retained their omnidirectional capability. Results from unsteady numerical simulations showed that the vented rotor attained a maximum average power coefficient (CP) of 0.275 at the tip-speed ratio (symbolized as λ) of 0.9, which was 21.7% better than that on the unvented rotor. Furthermore, the proposed dynamically vented blades produced large improvements in the average torque coefficient (CT), with maximum gains of 38.3% on the returning blade at λ = 0.4 and 24.8% on the full rotor at λ = 1.0, relative to those on the unvented rotor. The controlled dynamic venting was beneficial because it modified the pressure distributions surrounding the returning blade and changed the flow structure downstream of the vented blade that improved the torque on the subsequent blade entering the returning side. Elucidation on the flow dynamics revealed that the flows were vented outward through the flap aperture onto the convex side of the returning blade, rather than inward into its concave side, as initially hypothesized. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dynamic Performance; Flow Dynamics; Low-cost Solution; Renewable Energies; Rotor Blades; Rotor Performance; Savonius Turbine; Vertical Axis Turbines; Water Streams; Wind Stream; Turbomachine Blades","Dynamic performance; Flow dynamics; Low-cost solution; Renewable energies; Rotor blades; Rotor performance; Savonius turbine; Vertical axis turbines; Water streams; Wind stream; Turbomachine blades","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144628196"

Energy from the wind is one of the fastest-expanding kinds of sustainable energy, and it is essential in preventing potential energy issues in the foreseeable future. One pertinent issue is the many geometrical alterations that the scientific community has suggested to enhance rotor performance features. Hence, to address the challenge of developing a model that resolves these problems, the purpose of this investigation was to determine how well a scaled-down version of a Savonius turbine performed in terms of power output using a wind tunnel. Subsequently, the effect of the blockage ratio produced in the wind tunnel during the chamber test on the scaled model was evaluated. This study discusses the influences of various modified configurations on the turbine blades’ torque and power coefficients (Cp) at various tip speed ratios (TSRs) using three-dimensional (3D) unsteady computational fluid dynamics. The findings showed that the scaled model successfully achieved tunnel blockage corrections, and the experimental results obtained can be used in order to estimate how the same turbine would perform in real conditions. Furthermore, numerically, the new models achieved improvements in Cp of 19.5%, 16.8%, and 12.2%, respectively, for the flow-guiding channel (FGC at Ⴔ = 30°), wavy area at tip and end (WTE), and wavy area on the convex blade (WCB) models in comparison to the benchmark S-ORM model and under identical wind speed conditions.

The experimental investigation to improve its performance is a big challenge as; it is expensive, complicating and time consuming. Numerical prediction using CFD simulation could be a valuable alternative. This paper introduces a new modification of Savonius wind rotors to improve its performance. The proposed modification consists of a curtain arrangement together with fin addition on blade. The effect of the proposed modification was predicted using a CFD simulation employing ‘ANSYS FLUENT 16′. The curtain arrangement was located in front of the rotor to avoid the opposing torque to the rotor rotation. The fins were added to exploit the space in the blade for guiding the wind flow. The performance of the rotor with different curtain arrangements and variable number of fins was predicted and assessed against that of the conventional rotor. This comparison aimed to optimize the geometrical data of the proposed curtain arrangement with the number of added fins. The maximum power coefficient of the Savonius wind rotor was found to be increased to about 42 % with the optimum curtain arrangement (lengths of the curtain blades 1000 and 1150 mm and the angles of the curtain blades 30 and 50) together with adding only one fin. The simulation results showed that the performance of Savonius wind rotors could be significantly enhanced with a proper selection of curtain arrangement and number of fins to be added on the blade. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cfd Simulation; Curtaining; Fin Addition; Savonius Turbines; Vawt; Wind Energy; Computational Fluid Dynamics; Turbine Components; Turbomachine Blades; Wind Power; Cfd Simulations; Curtaining; Fin Addition; Numerical Predictions; Performance; Rotor Performance; Savonius Rotor; Savonius Turbine; Savonius Wind Rotor; Vertical Axes Wind Turbines; Fins (heat Exchange)","Computational fluid dynamics; Turbine components; Turbomachine blades; Wind power; CFD simulations; Curtaining; Fin addition; Numerical predictions; Performance; Rotor performance; Savonius rotor; Savonius turbine; Savonius wind rotor; Vertical axes wind turbines; Fins (heat exchange)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128463630"

However, the experimentally reported efficiencies motivate the scientific community to develop new geometries in order to improve its performance. First, it is not clear how the efficiency of the turbine is obtained and second, not all studies report it. The turbine is mainly made up of a tank, the rotor and the electric generator. The geometry of the tank is important because it stabilizes the f luid and in this component that the generation of the vortex is induced, which determines, added to other factors like tank geometry and runner, the global efficiency of the turbine. The primary purpose of this study is to compare numerically the torque generated at six (6) geometrical configurations of the basin inlet channel for Gravitational Vortex Turbine (GVT) with a Savonius rotor. The study was developed in ANSYS® CFX, where a transient state VOF model was configured with a BSL K-ω turbulence model and a discretization a discretization of the control volume made in the ICEM module. The highest torque was 0.553 Nm at 25 rpm for the trapezoidal curved inlet channel geometry, increasing the efficiency respect to the conventional Square inlet channel of the 2.73 %. The increase of tangential velocity contributes positively to the vortex generation, and consequently, an increase in torque is obtained. On the other hand, the design of the rotor considerably affects the performance of the GVT, where it may or may not take advan-tage of the kinetic energy of the vortex. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Basin; Cfd; Energy; Geometry; Inlet-channel; Performance; Runner; Torque; Turbine; Vortex","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142758258"

The flow aspects around the new blade are analyzed and quantitatively compared with that of the conventional and other blade configurations. The results imply a dependency of the rotor performance on the blade shape, demonstrating an appropriate configuration that produces the highest coefficient of torque and power. The newly optimized configuration is recognized with the peak of power coefficient at a tip speed ratio (TSR) of 1.5, which is more than two times higher than the conventional one. This makes the Savonius rotor better applicable to the urban environment. Importantly, this blade significantly increases the power coefficient by 6.3% at TSR < 1.0, known as a typical working condition in rural areas.

This work scrutinizes the energy content distribution among the gusty wind components and their differential impacts on the control response to identify factors to improve response timeliness. Cross-correlation spectrum analysis between the wind turbine response and the local wind spectrum was used to identify the critical tracking frequency that can significantly reduce the average response delay of wind turbines in gusty wind conditions while maximizing the gust energy harvesting ability was developed and validated by various time-domain simulation results. Combining the critical tracking frequency with the theoretical estimation of the EEC of a wind turbine, the expected EEC harnessing ability of a wind turbine can be estimated before installation.

The passive deflector can passively adjust its position with the change in wind direction so that the efficiency of the Savonius rotor is improved regardless of wind directions.

The simple Bach model has a maximum coefficient of performance corresponding to the blade arc angle of 45 deg and 225 deg. However, it consists of negative torque at the rotational angles of about 120–180 deg and 300–360 deg. Moreover, in the newly developed helical Bach, rotors can reduce the variation in torque in the rotational cycle; thereby, uniform torque is achieved in all angular position with improved performance.

However, the open-ended blades generate tip loss effects that reduce the power output. Wingtip devices such as winglets and endplates are commonly used in aerofoil design to increase performance by reducing tip losses. In this study, a CFD simulation is conducted using the sliding mesh method and the k-ω SST turbulence model on a two-bladed NACA0018 VAWT. The aerodynamic performance of a VAWT with offset, symmetric V, asymmetric and triangular endplates are presented and compared against the baseline turbine. The simulation was first validated with the wind tunnel experimental data published in the literature. The simulation showed that the endplates reduced the swirling vortex and improved the pressure distribution along the blade span, especially at the blade tip. The relationship between TSR regimes and the tip loss effect is also reported in the paper. Increasing VAWT performance by using endplates to minimise tip loss is a simple yet effective solution. However, the improvement of the power coefficient is not remarkable as the power degradation only involves a small section of the blades. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blade Tip Losses; Cfd; Darrieus Vawt; Endplate; Wingtip Device; Lift; Turbulence Models; Vertical Axis Wind Turbine; Wind Tunnels; Aero-dynamic Performance; Aerofoil Blades; Blade Tip; Blade Tip Loss; Darrieus; Darrieus Vertical Axis Wind Turbine; Endplates; Tip Loss; Vertical Axes Wind Turbines; Wingtip Device; Computational Fluid Dynamics","Lift; Turbulence models; Vertical axis wind turbine; Wind tunnels; Aero-dynamic performance; Aerofoil blades; Blade tip; Blade tip loss; Darrieus; Darrieus vertical axis wind turbine; Endplates; Tip loss; Vertical axes wind turbines; Wingtip device; Computational fluid dynamics","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139941519"

There are many types of turbines, one of which is the Savonius Turbine, a kind of cross-flow turbine. In recent years, research on improving the performance of the Savonius turbine has continued to develop. Several factors that affect the performance of the Savonius turbine are external factors, geometry, and materials. One of the Savonius turbine performances is influenced by the rotor geometry. Several studies have shown that modification of the geometry of the Savonius rotor can improve turbine performance. Some of the changes made are variations in aspect ratio, overlap ratio, the shape of a blade, number of blades, and multistage. This research is a mini-review of the geometry modifications that influence the performance of the Savonius turbine. This study aims to show the geometric factors that influence the performance of Savonius and compare the magnitude of these factors' Influence in increasing the Savonius turbine's performance. Reviews show that the Aspect Ratio is directly proportional to performance. Overlap variation of 0 to 0.3 has resulted in the best performance on the Savonius turbine, but other factors also influence this factor. The modified shape of the blade provides an increase of 8% - 25%. Multi-Stage on the Savonius can be a combination factor with other factors to maximize the performance of the Savonius rotor.

This is attributed to the fact that such a source of power is free and widely available. Savonius wind rotor can work at low wind speeds which fits well the rural areas. Despite its cheap, robust, and simple design, the Savonius rotor has some negatives such as relatively low efficiency and high fluctuations of static torque. Given this, the main goal of this research is to improve the output power of the Savonius wind rotor by varying the blade thickness using numerical simulation. Investigation methods based on the rotational speed of the rotor tip, wind field characterizations, torque, and power coefficients are conducted. The K-ϵ/realizable model was utilized for simulating the rotor at 9 m/s wind speed via Ansys Fluent software. Results demonstrate that the newly-developed rotor with varying blade thickness has a less wind wake on the internal surface of the returning blade. Moreover, the suction vortices have a higher velocity for the new configuration causing a reduction in pressure on the outer side of the returning rotor which indicates less negative torque. Compared with the traditional Savonius blades, the new model shows a 40% performance enhancement in the maximum power coefficient. The maximum power coefficient is found to be 0.20.

It was proven that using a suitable deflector system has the potential to improve wind turbine efficiency. However, as previously identified in studies, the common drawback of using a flat deflector is the strong wake zone behind it. The present study aims to improve the overall performance of a drag-type wind turbine by using a cylinder deflector with a wake splitter plate to manage and mitigate the detrimental effect of the wake zone behind the deflector. The wake control and suppressing vortex shedding downstream of a circular cylinder have been divided into active and passive flow control techniques. Amid the latter control methods, the adoption of splitter plates has proven to be highly effective for wake control and suppressing vortex shedding behind the cylinder. Unlike previous studies, a cylinder deflector with the wake splitter plate will be utilized instead of the conventional deflectors to improve the efficiency of the wind turbine by disturbing the wake zone downstream of the deflector. To obtain a more efficient configuration, the effect of the variations of the wake splitter length (Ls/D), attachment angle (θwsp), and the count of wake splitters on the outputs such as generated torque coefficient (Cm), power coefficient (CP), and wake zone on the performance of the Savonius rotor were investigated via Computational Fluid Dynamics simulation. The results revealed that cylinder deflectors with the wake splitter increased the Savonius rotor's performance the most for almost all Tip Speed Ratios (TSRs). The average Cm and CP raised considerably up to 15% using a deflector with two wake splitters at TSR = 0.6 compared to the case without deflectors. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Circular Cylinders; Computational Fluid Dynamics; Drag; Efficiency; Vortex Flow; Vortex Shedding; Wind Turbines; Down-stream; Performance; Performance Enhancements; Power Coefficients; Savonius Rotor; Splitter Plates; Tip Speed Ratio; Vortex-shedding; Wake Control; Wake Zones; Wakes","Circular cylinders; Computational fluid dynamics; Drag; Efficiency; Vortex flow; Vortex shedding; Wind turbines; Down-stream; Performance; Performance enhancements; Power coefficients; Savonius rotor; Splitter plates; Tip speed ratio; Vortex-shedding; Wake control; Wake zones; Wakes","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137999357"

This study first concentrates on the validation of the numerical scheme against Blackwell’s experimental data of the conventional rotor. The computed flow physics around the modified rotor with the same diameter is then analyzed and compared with that of the conventional rotor during one rotation cycle. As the result, the modified rotor is outperforming the conventional one but keeping its unique features. The modified rotor offers exceeding performance at a tip speed ratio (TSR) greater than 0.8. The new peak of the power coefficient C<inf>p</inf> is reached at TSR = 1.4 which is a typical operating condition of the wind turbine in urban areas. The remarkable finding is that the suppression of the flow separation on the blade is an effective way to improve the rotor’s aerodynamic performance. As expected, the additional elliptical profile plays a key role in increasing the positive torque and in preventing the flow separation on the blade, especially at high TSR > 0.8.

These turbines can extract up to 20% of the energy from the wind. This study numerically analyzes the performance of a modified Savonius wind turbine equipped with secondary blades and slots. The k-ε standard method is used to simulate the turbulence flow around the turbine, and the simulation is performed using the ANSYS FLUENT 18.2 commercial code. The effects of distance between the main blade and the secondary blade, position of the secondary blade, the width of the main blade’s slot, and the profile of the secondary blade on the produced torque are studied and analyzed. The simulation is performed at four wind velocities: 3, 4, 5, and 6 m/s. The results showed that the output torque at the secondary blade angular position β = 130 is higher than other angles. Furthermore, by increasing the radius of the additional blade from R = 25 to 43 mm, the torque is improved, and the area below the output torque curve is increased. Moreover, the results showed that creating a slot on the main blade equipped with a secondary blade has a significant impact on the produced torque; however, the geometrical parameters of the proposed rotors should be adjusted accurately to find the best case in terms of the produced torque. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Renewable Energy; Savonius; Torque; Vertical Axis Wind Turbine; Wind Turbine","wind turbine","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137666672"

Among the renewable energy resources available, wind energy is considered one of the reliable, environmentally friendly, green and fastest-growing source of electricity generation. This generation is accomplished through wind turbines. However, the efficiency of these wind turbines is still very limited and unsatisfactory. The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the performance of a Savonius rotor wind turbine in terms of aerodynamic characteristics, including torque, torque coefficient, and power coefficient. The design of Savonius wind turbine blades is varied and its effects is observed. The simulation models are developed using a modeling software known as Solidworks 2021 and then generated into Ansys Design Modeler 2021 R1 to define the fluid domain. In total, three distinct turbine blades are modelled while varying the diameter and height of the rotor. The simulation study is performed using FLUENT 2021 R21. A constant wind speed value of 9.2 m/s has been used throughout the simulation. The simulation was carried out using a transient time flow with a constant upstream wind speed. The results have shown that the power coefficient of all models increases with TSR and the highest efficiency is consensually obtained at almost a unity (0.9) TSR. Comparing the performance of all models, Model 2 generates the highest power coefficient followed by Model 3 and Model 1, respectively.

In this paper, a novel self-starting mechanism is proposed for VAWTs. The proposed concept centres on the use of pliable plates in either of two distinct configurations: (i) with plates attached to the trailing edge of the rigid airfoil-shape blades of the VAWT; (ii) with plates installed inside the VAWT at a distance from the rotor. The feasibility of these designs for self-starting has been investigated theoretically. In particular, flexible blades are idealized as cantilevered beams placed at an angle to a uniform steady flow. Using a Hamiltonian framework, a geometrically-exact fluid-elastic continuum model is developed for the extremely large-amplitude deflections of the flexible blades. The fidelity of the developed framework is first validated against two sets of experimental data available in the literature. The developed framework is then used to estimate the static torque coefficients generated by the flexible plates in both aforementioned VAWT configurations. Finally, the self-starting efficacy of the proposed design is compared against a Savonius based mechanism used in a well-studied benchmark Darrieus–Savonius turbine. The numerical simulations reveal that, regardless of the initial static positions of the turbine, proper engineering of the pliable plates results in a torque generation capability which spins the turbine, even at low wind speeds. This finding proves the feasibility of the proposed concept as a potential self-starting mechanism for VAWTs. The advantages of this mechanism, such as easier design, manufacturing and implementation, enhanced reliability and economical maintenance, make this concept worthwhile for further exploration. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cantilevered Plates In Axial Flow; Fluid–structure Interactions; Nonlinear Dynamics; Vertical Axis Wind Turbines; Axial Flow; Continuum Mechanics; Energy Harvesting; Plates (structural Components); Vertical Axis Wind Turbine; Amplitude Deformations; Cantilevered Plate In Axial Flow; Cantilevered Plates; Darrieus; Flexible Blades; Fluid-structure Interaction; Large Amplitude; Self-starting; Straight-bladed; Vertical Axes Wind Turbines; Wind Power","Axial flow; Continuum mechanics; Energy harvesting; Plates (structural components); Vertical axis wind turbine; Amplitude deformations; Cantilevered plate in axial flow; Cantilevered plates; Darrieus; Flexible blades; Fluid-structure interaction; Large amplitude; Self-starting; Straight-bladed; Vertical axes wind turbines; Wind power","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134878170"

Over the past few decades, extensive research has suggested turbine configurations that maximize their aerodynamic performance, evaluating different influencing geometric parameters. Nevertheless, few studies have considered running large-scale experimentation, simultaneously assessing different influencing parameters, and implementing mathematical optimization techniques. Consequently, there is a need to establish a set of procedures and techniques that address these gaps. The current research proposes a new design method for a Savonius wind turbine to maximize its aerodynamic performance. The proposed method defines a numerical model for a geometry with four influencing parameters, which automatically achieves solutions to the equations that govern the motion of fluids for different turbines. The model is successfully validated with experimental results available in the literature. The numerical solutions of 340 different turbines build a response surface with excellent quality metrics based on the Kriging technique. Two mathematical optimization techniques are implemented on the response surface to determine the configuration that maximizes its aerodynamic performance. This optimal configuration is characterized under different operating conditions. The results indicate that the optimal turbine has an aspect ratio of 8.38, an overlap ratio of 0.08, a twist angle of 174.05°, and two blades. The behavior shown by the optimal turbine (maximum power coefficient of 0.21 at a wind speed of 12 m/s) is remarkable since its aerodynamic performance is superior to multiple reported turbines. The instantaneous torque that it develops is always positive during its operation, which indicates a greater capacity for self-starting and continuity in its rotation. Likewise, it supplies a maximum rotor power of approximately 160 W at a wind speed of 12 m/s. These results make the optimal turbine an attractive design for electric power generation. The proposed method provides novel insights and powerful tools for researchers to explore various geometries and operating conditions that, together with the established optimization process, accomplish the turbine that maximizes its aerodynamic performance. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computational Fluid Dynamics; Optimization; Performance; Response Surface; Savonius Wind Turbine; Aspect Ratio; Design; Electric Power Generation; Geometry; Numerical Methods; Optimization; Surface Properties; Wind; Wind Turbines; Aero-dynamic Performance; Geometric Design; Influencing Parameters; Mathematical Optimization Techniques; Optimisations; Performance; Response Surface; Savonius Wind Turbine; Self-starting; Wind Speed; Computational Fluid Dynamics","Aspect ratio; Design; Electric power generation; Geometry; Numerical methods; Optimization; Surface properties; Wind; Wind turbines; Aero-dynamic performance; Geometric design; Influencing parameters; Mathematical optimization techniques; Optimisations; Performance; Response surface; Savonius wind turbine; Self-starting; Wind speed; Computational fluid dynamics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129467704"

Computational fluid dynamics analysis was performed using the sliding and dynamic meshing techniques. Various datasets were employed in the design of experiments to determine optimal configurations. A quadratic equation based on a regression model was established, and response surface methodology was applied to determine the accuracy of the model by analysis of variance, goodness of fit, investigation of residuals, and R-squared values. The optimized chord length, number of blades, pitch angle, distance of blades from the central rotating shaft, and rotor height were obtained as 0.547 m, 03, -3.41 deg, 0.789 m, and 1.605 m, respectively. A standard H-rotor Darrieus configuration, comprising symmetric airfoils and existing Darrieus-Savonius hybrid VAWTs were also analyzed for comparison. The positive static torque coefficient at all azimuth angles indicates that the proposed hybrid wind turbine is completely self-starting. The output power of the standard Darrieus configuration is substantially zero below a wind speed of 3.65 m/s, indicating that it is not capable of converting the kinetic energy of the airflow into electrical power below this specified value. On the contrary, the self-starting speed of the proposed hybrid wind turbine is as low as 2.81 m/s with a rated power of 1.522 kW at a wind speed of 7.5 m/s.

The use of Savonius turbines can be a solution because it produces large torque even if installed at low wind speed. Savonius blade modification into a double blade with a combination of type L and U aims to capture greater wind energy while generating greater electrical power. The study was tested at speeds of 3, 5, 7, and 9 m/s with variable differences in the side in and out of the turbine. However, what is presented in this article is the test parameters at a wind speed of 7 m/s. The test obtained data in the form of torque, generator speed, voltage, and current produced by the turbine. Once analyzed it can be concluded that the best performance is produced by a single blade rotor, then the rotor is 1:1, 2:1, and the lowest performance is obtained from the 3:1 rotor.

Our simulation has been performed using the “k-Ɛ/realizable turbulence model” with the auxiliary of the “finite volume solver ANSYS Fluent 19.1”. The coefficients of the torque and power “Cp and Ct” are estimated for any case depending on the tip speed ratio (TSR). The contours of velocity, stress, pressure, and disturbance strength are obtained and studded for the rotor with EP. Finally, a wind tunnel test is performed to prove the simulation results. The numerical results exposed that the highest value of Cp is 0.25 at TSR = 0.7 for the rotor with EP with an improvement of 26% over the same rotor without EP. Moreover, results proved that the maximum improvement in Cp for the rotor with EP was 38% at TSR = 0.4.

The available experimental data on Savonius wind rotor have been used to train the ANN and GEP using matlab r2020b and genexprotools 5.0 software, respectively. The input variables used in ANN and GEP architecture include newly proposed design shape factors, number of blades and stages, gap and overlap lengths, height and diameter of the rotor, freestream velocity, end plate diameter, and tip speed ratio besides the cross-sectional area of the wind tunnel test section. Based on this, the unknown governing function constituted by the aforementioned input variables is established using ANN and GEP to approximate/forecast the rotor performance as an output. The governing equation formulated by ANN is in the form of weights and biases, while GEP provides it in the form of traditional mathematical functions.

The performance of the Savonius rotor was improved the most via the rotating cylinder deflector for almost all Tip Speed Ratios (TSRs).

To complement the experimental findings and to examine the flow behavior around the rotor blades, the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations have also been performed using ANSYS FLUENT software. The local torque is found to be greater around the advancing arc-elliptical blade than around the advancing semicircular blade. It has also been noticed that the pressure distributions over concave sides are similar regardless of the blade shape. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Arc-elliptical; Energy Conversion/systems; Energy Systems Analysis; Power Coefficient; Pressure Coefficient; Renewable Energy; Savonius Wind Rotor; Tip-speed Ratio; Computational Fluid Dynamics; Energy Harvesting; Reynolds Number; Systems Analysis; Wind Power; Arc-elliptical; Blade Profile; Ellipticals; Energy Conversion Systems; Energy Systems Analysis; Power Coefficients; Pressure Coefficients; Renewable Energies; Savonius Wind Rotor; Tip Speed Ratio; Wind Tunnels","Computational fluid dynamics; Energy harvesting; Reynolds number; Systems analysis; Wind power; Arc-elliptical; Blade profile; Ellipticals; Energy conversion systems; Energy systems analysis; Power coefficients; Pressure coefficients; Renewable energies; Savonius wind rotor; Tip speed ratio; Wind tunnels","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119015678"

They not only denote phase separations and boundary conditions, but also thin flames and discontinuity waves. Fluid Mechanics at Interfaces 2 examines cases that involve one-dimensional or bi-dimensional manifolds, not only in gaseous and liquid physical states but also in subcritical fluids and in single- and multi-phase systems that may be pure or mixed. Chapter 1 addresses certain aspects of turbulence in discrete mechanics, briefly describing the physical model associated with discrete primal and dual geometric topologies before focusing on channel flow simulations at turbulence-inducing Reynolds numbers. Chapter 2 centers on atomization in an accelerating domain. In one case, an initial Kelvin-Helmholtz instability generates an acceleration field, in turn creating a Rayleigh-Taylor instability which ultimately determines the size of the droplets formed. Chapter 3 explores numerical studies of pipes with sudden contraction using OpenFOAM, and focuses on modeling that will be useful for engines and automobiles. Chapters 4 and 5 study the evaporation of droplets that are subject to high-frequency perturbations, a possible cause of instabilities in injection engines. The Heidmann model, which replaces the droplets in motion in a combustion chamber with a single continuously-fed droplet, is made more complex by considering the finite conduction heat transfer phenomenon.

With the rapid development of urban areas, high wind energy resources such as high-rise building rooftops are excellent locations for urban wind turbine installation. One of the practical and simple urban wind turbines is the Savonius design. It has a simple design, easy to maintain, and is very affordable. This work focuses on the design evaluation of a Savonius wind turbine (SWT) by varying the rotor diameter, rotor height, and twist angle for urban applications. A transient computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach is applied to assess the various design treatments using a space-filling design of experiments. To address the spaces in the hypercube statistical design, a sphere packing design method was adopted which suited the evaluation of computational simulations results such as that of the CFD. The Gaussian stochastic process model was applied to establish the trend of the parametric performance of the optimized SWT design through the model fitting. The results have shown that optimized SWT performs well with its self-starting capability compared to the traditional Savonius design.

The objective of this novel deflector produced from nanofibers was to diminish the detrimental effect of the complicated wake zone made behind the standard solid deflector, which had not yet been analyzed. Different PVA and PLA nanofibers concentration ratios were evaluated experimentally before being included in the numerical simulation to find the most appropriate porosity value and average pore size. These nanofibers with concentration ratios of 100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75, and 0:100 (v/v) were fabricated by electrospinning method. Then, the performance of conventional Savonius turbine and deflector arrangements was thoroughly studied using Computational Fluid Dynamics. Variations of power, torque, and flow structure were compared between configurations of the deflector and the conventional Savonius rotor to prove how the nanofiber-based deflector improved the performance of the turbine. It was revealed that a suitable porosity value existed for attaining the maximum performance of the Savonius turbine. Furthermore, utilizing a PVA75/PLA25 deflector with φ = 0.89, greater average torque and power coefficients (C<inf>m</inf> and C<inf>P</inf>) values were obtained. It is worth mentioning that using PVA75/PLA25 and PVA deflectors with greater porosity values completely eliminated the severe vortices behind the deflector. In rotation angles ranging from 100°–200° to 290°–360°, PVA75/PLA25 deflector substantially increased the C<inf>P</inf>. The average C<inf>P</inf> was raised by 7 and 9% using solid and PVA75/PLA25 deflectors, respectively. Accordingly, the solid and PVA75/PLA25 deflectors enhance not only the power coefficient but also the ability to self-start.

A crossflow wind turbine is a drag-based small vertical axis wind turbine, which is suitable for small-scale power generation in the built environment because of its low aerodynamic noise. However, the power performance of a crossflow wind turbine is generally lower than that of a Savonius wind turbine. Aiming at improving the performance of a crossflow wind turbine, this study develops a wind concentrator by adding two parallel plates with flanges, which is based on the “wind lens” concept, to an arc-shaped windshield, which is based on an existing concept of a flow deflection device for a crossflow wind turbine. The effects of adding two parallel plates with flanges to the windshield (i.e., the effects of the wind concentrator) on the performance of the crossflow wind turbine are quantified with wind tunnel experiments and analyzed based on the flow field characteristics obtained by computational fluid dynamics simulations. The experimental results show that the wind concentrator enhances the maximum power coefficient of the crossflow wind turbine by 108% from 0.12 (without wind concentrator/windshield) to 0.25 (with the wind concentrator), whereas the arc-shaped windshield improves it by 48% from 0.12 to 0.17 (with the windshield). The numerical simulations reveal that the main cause for the power performance enhancement is a downward deflection of the approaching flow to the upper part of the rotor because of a significant increase in the pressure level on the upwind side of the upper flange and an overall decrease in the pressure level in the wake of the wind concentrator. In conclusion, adding two parallel plates with flanges to an arc-shaped windshield is effective for significantly enhancing the power performance of a crossflow wind turbine. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computational Fluid Dynamics; Crossflow Wind Turbine; Vertical Axis Wind Turbine; Wind Concentrator; Wind Tunnel Experiment; Aerodynamics; Computational Fluid Dynamics; Concentration (process); Wind Tunnels; Cross Flows; Crossflow Wind Turbine; Parallel Plates; Power Performance; Pressure Level; Small Wind Turbine; Vertical Axes Wind Turbines; Wind Concentrator; Wind Tunnel Experiment; Wind Turbines","Aerodynamics; Computational fluid dynamics; Concentration (process); Wind tunnels; Cross flows; Crossflow wind turbine; Parallel plates; Power performance; Pressure level; Small wind turbine; Vertical axes wind turbines; Wind concentrator; Wind tunnel experiment; Wind turbines","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124325260"

This study employs a wind accelerator called “wind-lens” for Savonius wind turbine in single-rotor and twin-rotor configurations to harness more viable energy even in the low-speed region. The results of the present study can help designers and scientists to interpret the effective parameters of the proposed system for further development. High-fidelity numerical simulations are performed to investigate operational parameters like tip speed ratio and geometric parameters such as the rotational direction and position of the rotors within the wind-lens. Also, using the pressure and velocity contours along with the streamlines, an attempt is made to describe the power improvement by the proposed system.

The system consists of a rotor plate that is driven by the vertical shaft of the turbine and a stator with a vertically installed piezoelectric cantilever beam. Several magnets are mounted on the rotor and one magnet is attached at the free end of the cantilever as a tip mass. The alternating magnetic interaction force between magnets on the stator and the rotor induces deflection and strain on the piezoelectric layer that generates power. The arrangement of the magnets, wind speed, and resistive loads are some parameters that play important roles in the output power that are relatively investigated by experiments with the same conditions. Based on experimental results, by increasing resistive load, output power increases and then decreases. The same trend was observed for the gap distance between magnets mounted on the rotor and the stator. The 11 mm gap, 60 mm distance from the center, and 33 kΩ were obtained for the arrangement of the magnets on the rotor and also resistive load which leads to the highest power density of 0.85 μWcm-2 at 9.5 m/s wind speed using the standard circuit.

Presently solar energy is in use for domestic applications in most of the urban and rural areas. However, the availability of the solar energy will be during the day time and maximum during the summer season only. During the night and also during the monsoon and winter seasons the solar systems may not fulfil the energy requirement. On the other hand, wind will be steady with better velocity during the night and with higher velocity during the monsoon and winter seasons. Therefore, to generate the electric energy day and night throughout the year a rooftop hybrid wind-solar systems are better for domestic applications. In this direction in the present work, a compact and low-cost wind-solar tree of 500 W capacity is proposed. A metallic structure in a tree shape is installed with micro-wind turbines and solar panels. Savonius micro-wind turbines each with 100 W capacity at a wind velocity of 12 m/s are designed and fabricated. These turbines are coupled with low torque axial flux permanent magnet generators. Four number of polycrystalline solar modules each with 40 W capacity are used in this work. Wind turbines and the solar panels are mounted in a pattern on the metallic tree structure to harness the renewable wind and solar energy more effectively. From performance study it is observed that the wind turbines at wind velocity of 8.2 m/s produced total 75 W of power and on a sunny day the solar modules produced 126 W power at 14 Hrs of a day.

Renewable energy has seen an unprecedented interest as a sustainable energy source to meet ever-increasing energy demands. In addition to being a sustainable and clean energy source, renewable resources can be used indefinitely because they can never be depleted practically. The energy sources like wind and sunlight regenerate or replenish themselves on their own. Solar energy is widespread and freely available all over the world. Additionally, the global wind supply is sufficient to meet energy needs of mankind. The current study conceptualized and implemented a modified Savonius rotor design for vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT) with an integrated solar panel on top. The innovative design concept of the proposed prototype model allows it to be scaled up and mounted on highway medians to take advantage of airflow from both sides of the road. In essence, this hybrid power generation system combines two energy sources, namely wind turbine to harness wind energy and solar panel to addon further electrical energy, essentially providing energy throughout the day.

They have merits of simple structure and construction, easy installation and maintenance. Darrieus wind turbines can capture wind from any direction and convert it into electric power. They do not need any yaw mechanism to adjust their orientations in order to make their rotors face wind direction. Because of their lift-type, the power conversion efficiency is relatively high compared with drag-type vertical axis wind turbines like Savonius wind turbines. Although the merits of Darrieus wind turbines are remarkable, they also have their demerits. Compared with other types of vertical axis wind turbines, Darrieus wind turbines have relatively low static torque that weakens their self-starting capability. This research is motivated by surmounting the disadvantages facing Darrieus wind turbines. The research objective is focused on improving Darrieus wind turbines' static and dynamic performance. In this research, Darrieus wind turbines with different blade shapes and numbers are simulated. The effects of the design parameters on the performance of Darrieus wind turbines are analyzed.

Specifically for mini and micro rotors in urban environment applications this solution demonstrated to be very attractive. The possibility to overcome the Betz limit for power coefficient was widely demonstrated in ducted horizontal axis wind turbines. However, very few studies have dealt with ducted Savonius rotor despite these rotors represented an efficient solution for urban environment thanks to their simplicity, their cheapness and the low cut in velocity in highly turbulent conditions as well. Furthermore, the ducted Savonius concept, might be applicable to oscillating water column wave energy devices, thanks to its self-rectifying capability and simplicity. For these reasons, the authors carried out an experimental campaign to verify the impact of ducting the Savonius rotor, thus leading the way for a possible exploitation of this configuration in many practical applications. Specifically, The present paper deals with a study of ducted Savonius type air turbine performance. In particular, turbine performance was studied as a function of turbine overlap ratio. Four overlap ratios were tested: 0, 1/6, 1/3 and 1/2. A specific experimental setup was built to test ducted turbine, while bare turbine performance was measured using a wind tunnel. All tests were performed at fixed air velocity: 5 m/s. On the basis of the results, it is possible to state that ducted turbine performance is higher than bare turbine performance, at all tip speed ratios and for all overlap ratios. The optimal turbine overlap ratio is equal of 1/3. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Air; Sustainable Development; Turbine Components; Urban Planning; Wind Tunnels; Wind Turbine Blades; Ducted Turbines; Micro Rotors; Overlap Ratios; Power Coefficients; Rotor Performance; Savonius Rotor; Scientific Community; Turbine Performance; Urban Environments; Wind Turbine Rotors; Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine","Air; Sustainable development; Turbine components; Urban planning; Wind tunnels; Wind turbine blades; Ducted turbines; Micro rotors; Overlap ratios; Power coefficients; Rotor performance; Savonius rotor; Scientific community; Turbine performance; Urban environments; Wind turbine rotors; Horizontal axis wind turbine","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146495734"

At present, propeller-type wind-turbines are the most widely spread. They are produced on a commercial level in many countries. Other conditions being equal, the power produced by wind power unit (WPU) is proportional to the area being swept around by a wind wheel. Therefore, Megawatt propeller-type wind turbines have blades with the length of 40 and more meters. Only aircraft works with a highly-qualified personnel and corresponding equipment can produce such long blades of a specific shape.

The peak power coefficient values were achieved only at relatively high Reynolds number (Re>800k). This was initially shown only using wind-tunnel investigations, and these results were strengthened by many subsequent numerical studies which have shown good correlation with the experimental data. In recent SWT research, the objective is mostly related to increasing relatively low SWT efficiency. One of the notable SWT blade shape modifications to show significant improvement was proposed by Bach and Benes in [2]–[4]. The modified blade shape was composed a straight part in the inner rotor part and a circular-arc (spanning less than 180°) on the outer part. The peak power coefficient was increased from 22% to 28%. Different recent studies attempted further improvement using complex curves such as elliptical [5], spline [6] or multiple smaller quarter [7], with no major improvement. A major improvement was achieved in numerical shape-optimization studies with the novel ""scooplet-based"" SWT [8] with efficiency increased to 37% using 2D CFD and 34% using 3D CFD [9]. In previous numerical studies, the Reynolds number is usually fixed at relatively large values near Re=1M. However, this number is difficult to achieve in small-scale wind tunnels. In the current study, an experimental study of the optimized SWT turbine was performed in low-speed wind tunnel at Reynolds number 130k. The experiments were first performed for the classical SWT for which the expected results are known from previous studies. The improvement of the novel desing was then measured relative to the classical SWT design. The experiments were performed at a fixed wind velocity equal to v=5.6 m/s. The rotor diameter in all cases was D=0.36m (r=0.18m) and height H=0.4m. The rotational speed ω was controlled using a DC generator connected to variable resistor. The tip speed ratio (TSR=rω/v) was varied between TSR=0.5 and TSR=1.25. The electrical power was measured from the generated current (I) and the voltage (U) over resistor. The static mechanical torque (T<inf>0</inf>) was measured independently of the electrical power, and the estimated aerodynamic power was calculated by P=UI/η+T<inf>0</inf>ω. The main unknown is related to generator efficiency η. However, the same setup was used for measuring both turbine types, so that the relative difference should be reliable. To complement the experimental results, numerical analysis was performed using the same setup as in the experiment. The same 3D CFD model as in [9] was used, but with the geometry matching the performed experiment. For classical SWT, the peak power coefficient at Re=130k was estimated using CFD to be 21% at TSR=0.8. In the experimental data, the highest aerodynamic power also happened to be at TSR=0.8 with c<inf>P</inf>=19%. The peak power coefficient of the novel SWT using CFD was 29% also at TSR=0.8. Meanwhile, the experiment show peak efficiency of 26% at TSR=0.9 (which was only slightly lower at TSR=0.8). This is a 37% relative improvement of the novel design over the classical SWT. The CFD results and previous experimental studies predict that the power coefficient will significantly increase at higher Reynolds number which will be the topic of a future work. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145280735"

Darrieus rotors exhibit high power coefficient but suffer from lower self-starting capabilities. On the other hand, Savonius rotors demonstrate relatively high self-starting capabilities but with an inferior power coefficient. Therefore, the current study proposes three hybrid Darrieus-Savonius designs with different angles of twisting aiming at having a compact turbine with high coefficient of power and easy to self-start. The Savonius turbine is placed inside the Darrieus turbine in the three proposed hybrid designs. Accordingly, the trends of coefficient of power against ratio of rotor tip speed in addition to coefficient of torque over a whole cycle (360 degrees) are computed. The coefficient of static torque during a whole cycle is also calculated. Therefore, three dimensional, incompressible, and unsteady Reynolds-Average Navier-Stokes equations in conjunction with the turbulence model of k-ω shear-stress transport is developed and numerically simulated utilizing ANSYS Fluent. The devolved numerical model is validated using the available measurements from literature. The predicted characteristics of flow field over the three suggested hybrid designs are analyzed and presented. Accordingly, results illustrated that a significant enhancement of the coefficient of power is attained by suggested hybrid designs with twisting blades in comparison with the straight-bladed design. The model with twisted-bladed Darrieus and Savonius turbines with angles of twisting of 90o and 45o, respectively attains the largest peak of coefficient of power of 0.353. This hybrid configuration exhibits lower static torque fluctuations with positive values during the whole cycle. Consequently, using the suggested hybrid turbine with twisting blades improves both coefficient of power and the self-starting capability of the turbine. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Darrieus Turbine; Hybrid Design; Performance Improvement; Savonius Turbine; Twisted Blades; Navier Stokes Equations; Shear Stress; Torque; Turbine Components; Turbomachine Blades; Vertical Axis Wind Turbine; Wind Turbine Blades; Coefficient Of Power; Darrieus; Darrieus Turbine; Hybrid Design; Performance; Performance Improvement; Savonius Turbine; Self-starting; Twisted Blade; Vertical Axes Wind Turbines; Turbulence Models","Navier Stokes equations; Shear stress; Torque; Turbine components; Turbomachine blades; Vertical axis wind turbine; Wind turbine blades; Coefficient of power; Darrieus; Darrieus turbine; Hybrid design; Performance; Performance improvement; Savonius turbine; Self-starting; Twisted blade; Vertical axes wind turbines; Turbulence models","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141532673"

Worldwide, wind energy is one of a clean, renewable source of green electricity. Fossil fuel is one of our most important sources of energy and its quantities are decreasing. However, wind is a renewable resource that can as stand by source with fuel. Wind turbines are used to harness the wind to generate energy. Vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs) are suitable for use in built sites because to their outstanding features, attractiveness, low noise, and safety. To achieve these objectives, vertical axis wind turbines with multiple blades (blades are made from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) material) have been designed, manufactured and studied experimentally to investigate its performance. Turbine's blade is a half cylinder in its shape. The blades rotational speed of the blades, the resulted torque (T), and generated power (P) of each configuration of the suggested turbine were determined for different wind speeds (1.5m/s, 2.5m/s, and 3m/s) and rotor radius of (30cm, 40cm, and50cm), respectively. The graphical relation between coefficient of power (Cp) and the tip speed ratio (TSR) and between coefficient of power (Cp) and angles of the blades were constructed. It was noted that performance of wind turbine is largely depends on wind speed, blade locations, and blade angle. The maximum value of the power coefficients (Cp = 13.056%) is noticed at 40cm and 1.5 m/s for blade radius and wind speed, respectively, specifically at TSR=1.3 and 450 blade angle. The maximum values of the Cp for all values of the effective parameters are noticed at 450 blade angle. In addition, higher values of Cp are achieved at the lower wind speeds and high blade radius, and that corresponds to higher TSR. Finally, VAWT is able to generate electricity for local use even at low wind speeds. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blade Angle; Blade Location; Power Coefficient; Tip Speed Ratio; Wind Speed; Wind Turbine; Chlorine Compounds; Fossil Fuels; Polyvinyl Chlorides; Speed; Turbine Components; Turbomachine Blades; Wind; Wind Power; Wind Turbine Blades; Blade Angle; Blade Location; Coefficient Of Power; Environmental Concerns; Low Wind Speed; Performance; Power Coefficients; Tip Speed Ratio; Vertical Axes Wind Turbines; Wind Speed; Vertical Axis Wind Turbine","Chlorine compounds; Fossil fuels; Polyvinyl chlorides; Speed; Turbine components; Turbomachine blades; Wind; Wind power; Wind turbine blades; Blade angle; Blade location; Coefficient of power; Environmental concerns; Low wind speed; Performance; Power coefficients; Tip speed ratio; Vertical axes wind turbines; Wind speed; Vertical axis wind turbine","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138914440"

Water and wind are considered as environmental potential resources which have become attractive features of urban utilization through different wind and hydrokinetic turbine design technology. While no large-scale Savonius turbines have been developed yet, one of the popular designs is the small-scale rotor, which utilizes a drag-based vertical axis. The advantages of this type of rotor are easy to design, inexpensive, perform well at low speed, and have the capacity to turn independently to the wind-water direction flow. However, through a number of investigations on the performance the Savonius rotor, it was found to suffer from inefficient operation and a large amount of negative torques produced by the returning blade. To resolve the limitations in performance of the Savonius turbine, many optimization techniques and assessments have been conducted on different rotor types. The studies presented and discussed the challenges and changes in variations of rotor design parameters and their significant influence on rotor performance. In order to increase the unit's output without extra cost, improving variable parameters and reducing torques were accomplished in the negative direction while decreasing maintenance cost.

Unfortunately, the HAWT is only suitable for high wind speed areas. The Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT) is considered the ideal model to utilize wind energy in the low wind speed region. However, VAWT has a lower power coefficient. Therefore, developing a VAWT wind farm can improve the overall energy density for power generation in the low wind speed region. In this study, staggered configuration for three turbine clusters is evaluated through numerical simulation and experimental tests. The pitch distance is set by using the rotor's diameter as a reference for placing the 3rd rotor at the second row. The turbulence intensity in the area wake superposition is highly affected by the position of the 3rd rotor. The flow characteristic indicates that the 3D layout has a high concentration at the front area of the 3rd rotor. It leads to higher achievement of power ratio for the clusters. The overall power ratio for 3D layout can achieve more than 0.9, whereas, at a speed 3 m/s, the highest power ratio is obtained at 1.0.

Power plants, however, will then continue harming the earth because of the greenhouse gasses produced while generating energies that contribute to global warming. Using renewable sources to produce clean energies is one of the sustainable methods to deal with such challenges. Wind energy is one of the renewable sources, which is accessible anywhere on earth, creating green energy. Wind turbines are mainly categorized into Horizontal Axis Wind Turbines (HAWT) and Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWT). This paper firstly presents a general comparison between the HAWTs and VAWTs. Then, it presents mathematical modelling for the aerodynamic factors of HAWT and Darrieus VAWT to assist the researchers to understand some key design aspects of wind turbines, such as lift/drag ratio, tip speed ratio, power coefficient, and torque coefficient. Also, this paper presents a review of the aerodynamic performance of the recent VAWT designs to help researchers to identify and choose the best model among the Savonius and Darrieus rotors for further development or designing a new model at different wind conditions. This comparison review shows that for a large scale HAWT upwind 3 bladed wind turbines are the most optimum. The helical Savonius rotors perform better by having positive torque coefficient at all azimuth angles. Moreover, helical Darrieus was found to produce lesser noise and suitable for conventional areas. hybrid Savonius-Darrieus rotors can solve the self-starting challenge of the VAWTs, and they are suitable at low wind speeds. At last, this review shows some of the recent hybrid Savonius-Darrieus rotors which would help to solve the low efficiency of Savonius rotor and self-starting challenge of Darrieus rotors. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Hawt; Renewable Energy; Vawt; Wind Turbine","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124369942"

Savonius rotor works with drag forces not lift forces as generally in many wind turbine does. However, the Savonius rotor is having the lowest efficiency when it is used as an aerodynamic application because power coefficient (Cp) is lowest. many research works are going on to increase the power coefficient of Savonius rotor by different methods such as providing guiding blade, providing cross over the path between the blades, etc. It is also being proved that the speed of Savonius rotor in WECS reduces with increase in the number of blades, but the characteristics of the speed of Savonius rotor in hydrokinetics is not known. In this paper, an attempt is made to investigate the performance of the Savonius rotor with various blade arrangements in hydrokinetic applications.

The present study aims at designing and developing a vertical-axis Savonius wind rotor, and its subsequent testing in a wind tunnel. The key parameters affecting a Savonius rotor’s output are its blade shape, aspect ratio, overlap ratio and blade number. Considering the various aspects of blade design reported in the literature, a novel arc-elliptical-bladed Savonius wind rotor has been developed. The overlap ratio and aspect ratio are chosen to be 0.15 and 1.1:1, respectively. The testing of the rotor has been conducted in a subsonic wind tunnel under different loading conditions. The power coefficients are estimated for a range of tip-speed ratios. Further, its output characteristics have been compared with conventional semicircular-bladed Savonius rotor.

To improve power coefficient, the influence of varying the stage aspect ratio is investigated. Therefore, two-, three-, and four-stage Savonius rotors at stage aspect ratios ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 with increments of 0.25 are considered. To determine performance parameters such as coefficients of torque, power, and thrust, a comprehensive three-dimensional unsteady incompressible turbulent flow model using Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations along with a k-ω shear stress transport turbulence model is developed. The developed numerical model is validated utilizing the available experimental results. Moreover, a novel assessment technique relying on flow field characteristics such as pressure distribution in conjunction with streamlines around the proposed multi-stage Savonius rotor with various stage aspect ratios is carried out. The contribution of each stage on the performance of the whole rotor is computed and presented. The findings of the current study illustrate that utilizing a multi-stage rotor with stage aspect ratio equal to or greater than 1.0 significantly enhances the output power. By rising the stage aspect ratio within the range of 0.5-1.5, the peak coefficient of power boosts from 0.163 to 0.213 for a two-stage rotor and from 0.183 to 0.23 for a four-stage rotor. In addition, three-stage rotors with stage aspect ratio ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 show increased average static coefficient of torque from 0.196 to 0.272 with positive values at whole rotation angles. This improves the self-starting abilities of the multi-stage rotor and makes it suitable in areas where the wind is intermittent and very low. Furthermore, raising the stage aspect ratio from 0.5 to 1.5 significantly mitigates the oscillations of both torque and thrust coefficients throughout the entire cycle for all multi-stages. This lowers the mechanical vibrations and noise emission during operation conditions. Accordingly, multi-stage Savonius rotors with stage aspect ratio equal to or greater than 1.0 are highly recommended for practical applications. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Navier Stokes Equations; Shear Flow; Shear Stress; Turbulence Models; Turbulent Flow; Vibrations (mechanical); Coefficient Of Power; Coefficient Of Torques; Incompressible Turbulent Flow; Operation Conditions; Performance Parameters; Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (rans)equations; Shear-stress Transport; Vertical Axis Wind Turbines; Aspect Ratio","Navier Stokes equations; Shear flow; Shear stress; Turbulence models; Turbulent flow; Vibrations (mechanical); Coefficient of power; Coefficient of torques; Incompressible turbulent flow; Operation conditions; Performance parameters; Reynolds averaged Navier Stokes (RANS)equations; Shear-stress transport; Vertical axis wind turbines; Aspect ratio","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85106022786"

These spacing are considered 3D (D = rotor diameter), 3.5D, 4D, 4.5D, 5D, and 5.5D. Experiments are performed in a hydraulic flume of 6 m length at 0.5 m/s velocities for different loading conditions. The optimum performance (i.e., coefficient of power and coefficient of torque) of both HSHKTs together is obtained at a distance of 4D. Consequently, the study is simulated through the ANSYS-CFX for 0.5 m/s upstream velocity and optimum performance is validated at L = 4D. Further, the study is extended in ANSYS-CFX for three HSHKTs arranged in arrays of different patterns, namely triangular and staggered formation.

The numerical analysis is carried out to estimate the optimum V-angle by maintaining 70 mm depth of water with an inlet velocity of 0.3090 m/s. The numerical study revealed that, for 80° V-angle rotor blade profile, the maximum coefficient of power was found to be 0.2279 at a tip speed ratio of 0.9.

The experiment was done under wind speed of 5.9 m/s, 7.0 m/s, 8.1 m/s, 9.3 m/s and 10.4 m/s.

A measurement device was specifically designed to record instantaneous rotational speed and output torque of the hydrokinetic rotor. The performance of the rotor and the near-rotor flow were studied comprehensively. The deflector angle and the upstream velocity were varied. The results show that the maximum power coefficient of the rotor reaches 0.463 at the deflector angle of 60°, approximately 2.5 times that obtained at the deflector angle of 30°. As the upstream water velocity increases from 0.63 m/s to 0.73 m/s, the maximum power coefficient of the rotor is increased by 22.8%. The deflector plate not only prevents the impingement of the upstream flow on the returning blade, but also guides the upstream flow toward the concave side of the advancing blade. As the deflector angle increases, more upstream water with high velocity is guided toward the concave side of the advancing blade. The Coanda-like flow arising at the convex side of the advancing blade is beneficial for the improvement of the rotor performance and is enhanced with increasing deflector angle.

In this study, it is calculated based on a quasi-static model of the aerodynamic action and compared with a similar force acting on the Savonius rotor. This force allows the Darrieus rotor to be used as an element of a wind power plant operating based on the Magnus effect. The mathematical model of such a wind turbine with a horizontal shaft and two rotating blades in the form of Darrieus rotors is presented in the form of a fifth-order dynamic system. The parameter that characterizes the useful external electrical load in the local circuit of the electric generator of the plant acts as the gain of the control action in the model. As a result of the analysis, it is found that a wind turbine can have at least three types of operating modes. Two of them are characterized by the synchronization of the average angular velocities of the Darrieus rotors; in the general case, the average rotation speed of the central shaft is incommensurable with them. In the third type of modes, the proper rotation speeds of Darrieus rotors are incommensurable. The problem of choosing a control that provides the maximum value of mechanical power in the operating mode of the wind turbine is solved. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Flow Velocity; Rotation; Wind Power; Darrieus; Darrieus Rotors; Dynamics And Control; Horizontal Shafts; Magnus Effect; Magnus Forces; Operating Modes; Quasi Static Models; Rotation Speed; Savonius Rotor; Wind Turbines","Flow velocity; Rotation; Wind power; Darrieus; Darrieus rotors; Dynamics and control; Horizontal shafts; Magnus effect; Magnus forces; Operating modes; Quasi static models; Rotation speed; Savonius rotor; Wind turbines","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117344962"

Wave energy is currently considered to be one of the most promising renewable sources. It has seen significant recent development to increase its efficiency by incorporating new technologies, such as Savonius turbines, which had previously been used to generate wind energy. For the present study, a two-stage Savonius rotor was used in the wave generator. The simulation model of the entire hybrid power system was produced using MATLAB/Simulink and experimentally verified in a remote area under different weather conditions.

This proposed hybrid wind rotor has twisted Savonius blades with a modified blade profile combined with 2/3 Darrieus blades. The numerical simulations are aimed to explore the effects of the blade's attachment angle, radius ratio, and number of blades. The utilized Darrieus blades are straight, with an NACA0021 airfoil profile. It is clear from the hybrid rotors results obtained at a low radius ratio of β = 0.27 that, the optimum attachment angle is ϕ = 30°. Furthermore, there is a noticeable enhancement in the starting ability, especially through orientations where the standalone Darrieus rotor has degraded static torque. Different radius ratios, 0.25 to 0.5, are trained at the optimum attachment angle of 30°, for both 2 and 3 bladed hybrid rotors. It is found that the influence of the radius ratio variation on the performance of the tested hybrid rotors is more significant than that of the attachment angle and the optimum radius ratio is found to be β = 0.43.

The volume penalization vortex-in-cell (VP-VIC) method is applied for flow simulation, and the rotational motion of the rotor is analyzed using the calculation method previously proposed by the authors for the fluid force acting on the solid boundary (blade surface). As a result, the relationship between the rotational speed of the rotor and the output coefficient obtained in this simulation is similar in the experimental results of Golecha et al. [Appl. Energy 88, 3027-3217 (2011)] using S-shaped blades. In particular, with an increase in the load torque, the rotational speed of the rotor decreases, and the rotor stops momentarily. When the rotor stops, the positive torque of clockwise rotation acts on the advancing blade, while the negative torque of counterclockwise rotation acting on the returning blade decreases; hence, the rotor restarts immediately after stopping. In addition, it is established that the rotor output can be accurately predicted. Based on the above, it is reconfirmed that the VP-VIC method is beneficial for predicting the performance of a Savonius turbine. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cell Simulation; Design Tool; Fluid Analysis; Immersed Boundary Methods; Penalization Method; Rotor Diameter; Savonius Turbine; Vorticity Field","Cell simulation; Design tool; Fluid analysis; Immersed boundary methods; Penalization method; Rotor diameter; Savonius turbine; Vorticity field","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85110546841"

This study focuses on the impact of internal rotor parameters on the aerodynamic performance of the resultant hybrid rotor. For this goal, a two-blade Savonius rotor constructed by conventional semicircle blades with a constant overlap ratio of 0.2 is attached to a two-blade Darrieus rotor constructed by straight NACA 0018 blades. The resultant hybrid rotor has a constant diameter ratio of 0.2. To assess the Savonius wind turbine parameters, three various attachment angles of 0°, 45°, and 90° are examined under various wind potentials having average wind speeds of 5 and 10 m/s. A set of computations is performed at different tip speed ratios (TSR) of 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5. The obtained results have been validated against the available data for both Savonius and Darrieus rotors and good agreements are obtained from these comparisons. It is revealed that selecting an appropriate attachment angle is strongly dependent on the free-wind speed and TSR. Additionally, regardless of the free-wind speed, the hybrid rotor with an attachment angle of 45° presents the maximum power coefficient among the hybrid and non-hybrid rotors for TSR = 1.5 and 2.5. However, at TSR = 3.5, the hybrid rotor with ϕ = 0° and Darrieus rotor exhibit optimal performances among the considered cases at U<inf>∞</inf> = 5 m/s and 10 m/s, respectively. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Hybrid Rotor; Power Coefficient; Tip Speed Ratio (tsr); Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (vawt); Speed; Wind; Wind Power; Attachment Angle; Darrieus Rotors; Hybrid Rotor; Internal-rotor; Power Coefficients; Savonius Rotor; Tip Speed Ratio; Vertical Axis Wind Turbine; Wind Speed; Wind Turbines","Speed; Wind; Wind power; Attachment angle; Darrieus rotors; Hybrid rotor; Internal-rotor; Power coefficients; Savonius rotor; Tip speed ratio; Vertical axis wind turbine; Wind speed; Wind turbines","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104641984"

Despite the great influence of dynamic characteristics on start-up and stability of these rotors, as well as working in areas subjected to highly turbulent atmospheric boundary layer, dynamic characteristics and unsteady wind condition were neglected in most of the previous research. In this study, the turbine start-up characteristics have been investigated numerically considering the dynamic characteristics of the traditional Savonius rotor and unsteady sinusoidal upstream flow, using user-defined functions in Fluent software. The simulation results are highly consistent with the existing experimental results and hence, relatively accurate prediction of the start-up behavior of the Savonius turbine can be achieved. According to the obtained results, increasing the mean velocity leads to an increase in the growth rate of tip speed ratio. In addition, reducing the period in the upstream, hastens the rotor acceleration process. Moreover, by increasing the tip speed ratio up to 0.7, an increase in the torque coefficient can be seen, which is followed by a decreasing trend with further increase in tip speed ratio. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computational Fluid Dynamics (cfd); Savonius Rotor; Start-up; Unsteady Flow; Wind Turbine; Atmospheric Boundary Layer; Wind Power; Acceleration Process; Accurate Prediction; Dynamic Characteristics; Savonius Wind Turbine; Start-up Characteristics; Torque Coefficient; User Defined Functions; Vertical Axis Wind Turbines; Wind Turbines","Atmospheric boundary layer; Wind power; Acceleration process; Accurate prediction; Dynamic characteristics; Savonius wind turbine; Start-up characteristics; Torque coefficient; User Defined Functions; Vertical axis wind turbines; Wind turbines","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114204868"

Wind energy is one of the most important sources of renewable energy. In recent years designing and increasing the performance of wind turbine devices has been a significant effort of scientists. Savonius wind turbine is one of the vertical axis wind turbines. This type of wind turbine has some advantages such as self-starting ability even in the low-speed area, simple design, and low noise, which makes them stable for capturing wind energy in urban areas. But there is an undesirable negative torque that causes turbine performance to drop. Installing an upstream deflector can reduce the negative torque. Moreover, utilization of the wind-lens and Twin-rotor system increases the turbine performance. The effects of this proposed hybrid system on the performance of the Savonius wind turbine are investigated numerically using ANSYS-fluent software. In the present study, a complete investigation of geometric parameters such as width, distance from the wind-lens throat, and deflector angle on the performance of the turbine is evaluated. Results show a combination of the upstream deflector, wind-lens, and twin-rotors system increase the power coefficient of the turbine by about 121% relative to a single rotor Savonius wind turbine. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cfd; Hybrid System; Savonius Wind Turbine; Upstream Deflector; Vawt; Wind-lens; Hybrid Systems; Wind Power; Augmentation Systems; Performance Enhancements; Power Coefficients; Renewable Energies; Savonius Wind Turbine; Turbine Performance; Use Of Renewable Energies; Vertical Axis Wind Turbines; Wind Turbines","Hybrid systems; Wind power; Augmentation systems; Performance enhancements; Power coefficients; Renewable energies; Savonius wind turbine; Turbine performance; Use of renewable energies; Vertical axis wind turbines; Wind turbines","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114196735"

Two deflector plates positioned at the upstream of the turbine were tested inside a closed-circuit wind tunnel at an air flow speed of 7.0 m/s (equivalent to 0.4 m/s water flow speed). The self-starting capability of the turbine was characterized in terms of the coefficient of static torque, C<inf>TS</inf> at various advancing blade deflector angles and returning blade deflector angles of δ<inf>A</inf> = 15°, 30°, 45°, 60° and 75°and δ<inf>R</inf> = 30°, 60°, 90°, respectively. It was found that the C<inf>TS</inf> profiles were generally higher than without any deflector. The increment of δ<inf>R</inf> showed that it had a significant effect on the C<inf>TS</inf> profile due to the reduction of drag force on the returning blade as compared to the variation of δ<inf>A</inf>. The study highlighted that the C<inf>TS</inf> profiles shifted away from the no-self-start conditions (C<inf>TS</inf> < 0) with the presence of deflectors. The experimental results also revealed that the coefficient of power, C<inf>P</inf> significantly improved for the case with the deflectors, particularly at δ<inf>R</inf> =90°. The highest C<inf>P</inf> of 0.183 was achieved at δ<inf>A</inf> = 75° and δ<inf>R</inf> = 90°, which was also the optimal deflector configuration for the best self-starting characteristics.

This leads to a larger investment in comparison to horizontal axis wind turbine (HAWT) rotors using lift forces. A simple construction of the Savonius rotor is preferred to reduce the production effort. Therefore, it is proposed here to use single-segment rotors of high elongation. Nevertheless, this rotor type must be compared with a multi-segment rotor to prove that the simplification does not deteriorate the effectiveness. The number of segments affects the aerodynamic performance of the rotor, however, the results shown in the literature are inconsistent. The paper presents a new observation that the relation between the effectiveness of single-and multi-segment rotors depends on the wind velocity. A single-segment rotor becomes significantly more effective than a four-segment rotor at low wind speeds. At high wind speeds, the effectiveness of both rotors becomes similar. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Rotor Effectiveness; Rotor Experimental Testing; Savonius Rotor; Small Wind Turbines; Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (vawt); Drag; Wind Turbines; Aero-dynamic Performance; High Elongation; High Wind Speed; Horizontal Axis Wind Turbines; Power Characteristic; Production Efforts; Single Segments; Wind Velocities; Wind","Drag; Wind turbines; Aero-dynamic performance; High elongation; High wind speed; Horizontal axis wind turbines; Power characteristic; Production efforts; Single segments; Wind velocities; Wind","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85106864215"

A numerical–analytical iterative method is proposed for finding solutions close to periodic, corresponding to the autorotation modes of a mechanical system. Fixed points (including saddles) of the system averaged over two angles are used as a zero approximation. At each iteration, periodic solutions of two auxiliary subsystems are numerically constructed using an approach akin to the Andronov–Pontryagin method. Under the condition of the convergence of the method, a set of periodic functions is obtained, which presumably approximately describe trajectories close to periodic, in particular, quasiperiodic. The conditions for the applicability of the approach are discussed. The proposed method is illustrated by the example of finding the autorotation modes of two interacting Savonius rotors. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Andronov–pontryagin Method; Autorotation; Averaging Over Two Angles; Body In A Medium Flow; Numerical-analytical Method; Quasiperiodic Solution","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85110312687"

The purpose of this manuscript is to determine the efficiency of the pulverizing aerator unit in the windy conditions of Góreckie Lake. The efficiency of the pulverization aerator depends on the wind conditions at the lake. It was necessary to conduct thorough research to determine the efficiency of water flow through the pulverization segment (water pump). It was necessary to determine the rotational speed of the paddle wheel, which depended on the average wind speed. Throughout the research period, measurements of hourly average wind speed were carried out. It was possible to determine the efficiency of the machine by developing a dedicated mathematical model. The latest method was used in the research, consisting of determining the theoretical volumetric flow rates of water in the pulverizing aerator unit, based on average hourly wind speeds. Pulverization efficiency under the conditions of Góreckie Lake was determined based on 6600 average wind speeds for spring, summer and autumn, 2018.

Accordingly, single-, two-, three-, and four-stage Savonius rotors with twisted blades are investigated and compared with a single-stage rotor at corresponding aspect ratios ranging from 1 to 4. To determine performance parameters such as torque, power, and thrust coefficients, a comprehensive three-dimensional unsteady incompressible turbulent flow model using Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations along with k-ω shear-stress transport turbulence model is developed. The developed numerical model is validated using the available numerical and experimental results. Furthermore, a novel assessment technique relying on flow field characteristics such as pressure distribution in conjunction with streamlines around the proposed multi-stage Savonius rotor with twisted blades is carried out. The contribution of each stage on the performance of the whole rotor is also computed and presented. The findings of this study show that the new design of the multi-stage rotor with twisted blades significantly enhances the output power. The maximum power coefficient is found to be 0.253 for a two-stage rotor and reaches 0.261 for a four-stage rotor and about 0.223 for a single-stage rotor. In addition, the multi-stage rotor with twisted blades significantly mitigates the oscillations of both torque and thrust coefficients throughout the whole cycle. This lowers the mechanical vibrations and noise emission during operation conditions. The static torque coefficient is found to have positive values with smooth fluctuations at all rotational angles. This results in enhancing the self-starting capability of the multi-stage rotor with twisted blades and making it suitable in areas where the wind is intermittent and very low. The large benefits offered by the proposed multi-stage Savonius rotor with twisted blades model is comparable to alternate designs of vertical axis wind turbines currently in the market. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Multi-staging; Performance Improvement; Self-starting Capability; Twisted Blades; Wind Turbines; Aspect Ratio; Navier Stokes Equations; Shear Flow; Shear Stress; Turbulence Models; Turbulent Flow; Vibrations (mechanical); Multi-stages; Multi-staging; Performance; Performance Improvement; Savonius Rotor; Self-starting Capability; Single Stage; Torque Coefficient; Twisted Blade; Vertical Axes Wind Turbines; Wind Turbines","Aspect ratio; Navier Stokes equations; Shear flow; Shear stress; Turbulence models; Turbulent flow; Vibrations (mechanical); Multi-stages; Multi-staging; Performance; Performance improvement; Savonius rotor; Self-starting capability; Single stage; Torque coefficient; Twisted blade; Vertical axes wind turbines; Wind turbines","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102637416"

Wind power has now been seen as an alternative way to generate electricity. However, the existing wind turbines to harness this energy, which is used to transform wind kinetic energy into electricity still suffer low conversion capabilities. This study is therefore set out to evaluate the performance of a double-stage Savonius-type rotor while aiming to examine the effectiveness of this technique in increasing the efficiency while overcoming the inherent low inefficiency of the Savonius rotor. The simulations involved the use of the K-omega SST as the turbulent viscosity model. Three simulation models based on a different number of blades on the double-stage model are tested in terms of torque, power, torque coefficient and power coefficient. It is concluded that the double-stage technique was capable of enhancing the performance of the Savonius rotor. It was observed that more blades on a double-stage rotor have a negative effect on the performance of the Savonius rotor in terms of both torque efficiency and power efficiency. Comparing the three models, it was found that the two-blade model of the double-stage produced more torque and power output compared to the other three-blade and four-blade models of the double-stage Savonius rotor. Furthermore, the highest conversion efficiency in terms of power among all models occurs at the TSR of 0.6 with a corresponding maximum power coefficient of 18.4%. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Multi-stage Technique; Power Coefficient; Savonius Rotor; Torque Coefficient; Vawt; Wind Energy","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107481669"

Wind force is a resource with a high potential through which green energy can be obtained with no negative impact on the environment. Different turbine typologies have been developed, which can convert the wind force into mechanical and electrical energy through turbine rotational motion. Starting from the classic vertical-axis SAVONIUS rotor model, other models have been designed, which, according to the numerical studies and experimental test results, show higher performance parameters in operation. Such models present specific rotor blade geometries to achieve better operational results in terms of shaft torque and generated power. There are multiple research results from numerical analysis on virtual models or experimental tests that use rotor models in different constructive configurations aiming to improve operation performance. These research activities are related to the rotor blade number, the aspect and overlap ratio values, the blade profile geometry modification, the use of end plates connected to the rotor blades, curtain mounting solutions for directing the air flow on the active blade alone, and rotor constructive variants with deformable blades during operation.

The rotors were tested inside a closed-circuit wind tunnel both with and without a deflector with air as the flow medium. The air data obtained from the experiment were used to calculate the equivalent water flow speed based on the same Reynolds number. The density and viscosity of both mediums were taken into consideration to ensure that the flows were dynamically similar. It was found that the self-starting speeds of the rotors varied with respect to the initial rotor angle. The 3-bladed rotor had lower self-starting speeds than the 2-bladed rotor due to a smaller blade orientation. With the presence of the deflector positioned upstream of the returning blade, the self-starting speeds of both rotors were reduced for all tested deflector angles. The deflector shielded the returning blade of the rotors from being impinged by an incoming flow, reducing the negative torque that would hinder the rotor's rotational motion. The deflector angle of δ = 90° with respect to the incoming flow direction was found to be the optimal configuration, contributing the largest reduction in the self-starting speeds for all initial rotor angles for both rotors. In terms of rotor power performance, the deflector blocking the incoming freestream flow from impinging on the returning blade was found to significantly improve the coefficient of power of the rotors. The largest improvements of coefficient of power by 84.6% and 227.3% were obtained with the deflector configured δ = 90° for the 2-bladed rotor and the 3-bladed rotor, respectively, and the optimal deflector angle was found to be δ = 90°, regardless of the number of blades. The present study has demonstrated the practicality of using a deflector to improve the self-starting speed capability and power performance of Savonius rotors for hydrokinetic application in rivers with low water flow speeds, particularly the narrow and shallower rivers common in rural areas in developing countries. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deflector; Experiment; Hydrokinetic; Power Performance; Savonius Rotor; Self-starting Speed; Delta Wing Aircraft; Developing Countries; Flow Of Water; Hydraulics; Reynolds Number; Wind Tunnels; Closed Circuit; Coefficient Of Power; Free-stream Flow; Negative Torques; Power Performance; Rotational Motion; Savonius Rotor; Speed Capability; Speed; Experimental Study; Performance Assessment; Wind Tunnel","Delta wing aircraft; Developing countries; Flow of water; Hydraulics; Reynolds number; Wind tunnels; Closed circuit; Coefficient of power; Free-stream flow; Negative torques; Power performance; Rotational motion; Savonius rotor; Speed capability; Speed; experimental study; performance assessment; wind tunnel","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101310575"

To enhance their efficiency, the operating parameters have already been examined by various numerical and experimental techniques. While most researchers have focused on using selected turbulence models to arrive at some meaningful conclusions and recommendations, no study analyzing a range of turbulence models in a systematic and comprehensive manner is reported. This study thus aims at conducting 2-D unsteady numerical simulations of a conventional semicircular-bladed Savonius rotor using six different turbulence models, viz., standard k-ε, realizable k-ε, RNG k-ε models, standard k-ω and shear stress transport (SST) k-ω, and transition SST (TSST) turbulence models. The simulations are performed by commercial finite-volume method solver ANSYS Fluent 17.1 at a fixed Reynolds number (Re) of 1.23 × 105 based on the rotor overall diameter. This study demonstrates the prediction capabilities of realizable k-ε, RNG k-ε, SST k-ω, and TSST models more accurately than those of other models. However, due to higher computational cost associated with TSST model, the use of realizable k-ε, RNG k-ε, and SST k-ω models for predicting the aerodynamic performance of other developed and to-be-developed profiles of Savonius rotor is recommended. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aerodynamics; Electric Power Generation; Electric Power Plants; Finite Volume Method; Reynolds Number; Shear Stress; Aero-dynamic Performance; Computational Costs; Experimental Techniques; Operating Parameters; Prediction Capability; Shear-stress Transport; Unsteady Numerical Simulations; Wind Turbine Rotors; Turbulence Models","Aerodynamics; Electric power generation; Electric power plants; Finite volume method; Reynolds number; Shear stress; Aero-dynamic performance; Computational costs; Experimental techniques; Operating parameters; Prediction capability; Shear-stress transport; Unsteady numerical simulations; Wind turbine rotors; Turbulence models","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104864780"

The developed methodology couples the set of Unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes Equations (URANS) with the unsteady linear elasticity equations and dynamic mesh approach to comprehensively describe the deformations of the turbine rotor. The obtained results provide detailed information on the unsteady flow fields around the operating wind turbine as well as deformations of a turbine rotor caused by an interaction between solid and flowing air. This allowed us to determine the influence of the unsteady deformations of a turbine rotor on the instantaneous and average performance of a wind turbine. Computations were carried out for the wind speed equal to 15 m/s and the tip speed ratio equal to 0.8. The simulations were performed using the commercial ANSYS software. The obtained results showed that deformation of the turbine rotor increases the wind turbine power coefficient by around 5%. Moreover, it was shown that the centrifugal force has a significant effect on the rotor deformation and turbine operation, hence it cannot be neglected. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computational Fluid Dynamics; Finite Element Method; Fluid Structure Interaction; Savonius Wind Turbine; Vertical Axis Wind Turbine; Deformation; Fluid Structure Interaction; Turbine Components; Unsteady Flow; Wind; Wind Turbines; Fluid Structure Interaction Analysis; Linear Elasticity Equations; Modeling Operation; Savonius Wind Turbine; Two-way Fluid Structure Interactions; Unsteady Deformation; Unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier-stokes Equations; Vertical Axis Wind Turbines; Navier Stokes Equations; Elasticity; Navier-stokes Equations; Operations Technology; Performance Assessment; Software; Wind Turbine; Wind Velocity","Deformation; Fluid structure interaction; Turbine components; Unsteady flow; Wind; Wind turbines; Fluid structure interaction analysis; Linear elasticity equations; Modeling operation; Savonius wind turbine; Two-way fluid structure interactions; Unsteady deformation; Unsteady reynolds averaged navier-stokes equations; Vertical axis wind turbines; Navier Stokes equations; elasticity; Navier-Stokes equations; operations technology; performance assessment; software; wind turbine; wind velocity","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091565626"

Nowadays, they use in urban areas to generate electricity due to their simple structure, ease of maintenance, and acceptable power output under a low wind speed. However, their efficiency is low and the improvement of their performance is necessary to increase the total power output. This paper compares four various blade profiles in a two-blade conventional Savonius wind turbine. The ratios of blade diameter to the blade depth of s/d = 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 1 are tested under different free-wind speeds of 3, 5, and 7 m/s and tip speed ratios (TSRs) in the range from 0.2 to 1.2. It is found that the profile of blades in a Savonius rotor plays a considerable role in power characteristics. Also, regardless of blades profile and free-wind speed, the maximum power coefficient develops in TSR = 0.8. In addition, increasing the free-wind speed enhances the rotor performance of all cases under consideration. Finally, it is revealed that the rotor with s/d = 0.5 provides maximum power coefficients in all free-wind speeds and TSR values among the rotors under consideration, whereas the rotor with s/d = 1 is the worth cases. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blade Profile; Energy Conversion/systems; Power Coefficient; Renewable Energy; Savonius Rotor; Cost Effectiveness; Drag; Speed; Thermoelectric Power; Wind; Wind Power; Wind Turbines; Generate Electricity; Power Characteristic; Rotor Performance; Savonius Rotor; Savonius Turbine; Savonius Wind Turbine; Simple Structures; Tip Speed Ratio; Turbomachine Blades","Cost effectiveness; Drag; Speed; Thermoelectric power; Wind; Wind power; Wind turbines; Generate electricity; Power characteristic; Rotor performance; Savonius rotor; Savonius turbine; Savonius wind turbine; Simple structures; Tip speed ratio; Turbomachine blades","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091256561"

One of them is a Savonius wind turbine, where scientists propose adjustments to improve its aerodynamic properties. At present, their assessment is usually performed by means of transient computational fluid dynamics simulations with two- or threedimensional models. In this paper, the overset (chimera) mesh approach was applied to investigate the performance of a Savonius wind turbine equipped with deformable blades. They were continuously deformed during rotation by a dedicated mechanism to increase a positive torque of the advancing blade, and meanwhile, decrease a negative torque of the returning blade. A quasi-two-dimensional model with a two-way fluid-structure interaction method was applied, where the structural solver determined blade deflection caused by the predefined deformation mechanism and aerodynamic loads, whereas the coupled computational fluid dynamics solver determined the transient flow. The deformable blades rotor performance was calculated and compared with a conventional rigid Savonius turbine, both simulated using the overset mesh approach. The average value of the power coefficient achieved a 55% rise in the case of deformable blades turbine.

Wind energy is a clean alternative source compared to fuel consumption which can cause smoke pollution. In this research, the objective is to model and simulate a vertical wind turbine model based on several blades to be analysed in terms of velocity, friction, and pressure first before proceeding to develop and incorporate it in the simulation stage. The innovation acts as the foundation of vitality through wind turbines. Compared to horizontal wind turbines, vertical wind turbines have more advantages and benefits. Horizontal wind turbines require taller masts and blades which are more difficult to transport and construct. With higher required velocity, the wind turbine configuration ensures that higher velocity means the rotor rotates the fastest and delivers the best possible energy. The modelling of the vertical wind turbine is categorised into Darrieus and Savonius wind models using SolidWorks. Based on the simulated results, the best wind turbine model is Savonius with 2 blades. This model has the highest velocity, which displays 15.8991 m/s, compared to the 3 blades of the Savonius wind turbine. The 2-bladed Darrieus wind turbine produces a larger velocity, which is 11.3341 m/s, compared to the 3-bladed Darrieus wind turbine, which is 11.2147 m/s.

Indonesia has a limited amount of fossil energy. Meanwhile, energy consumption continues to increase along with the economic and population growth. Thus natural resources such as oil, gas, and coal are becoming more depleted, because they are not renewable energy. Indonesia is a tropical country located on the equator, as an archipelago with varied geological contours, more than 100 mountains, and also beaches. One of the energies that might be utilized is wind energy with an affordable cost and free pollutant output. Wind Turbines have become one of the feasible power plants to replace fossil energy. The mechanism of wind turbine is that the wind blows against the blades of the wind turbine, and allows the blades to rotate as the axis and produces a valuable source of renewable energy by repetitive rotational motion. This research was focused on finding a suitable generator for Savonius Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT) that can produce a high voltage at low RPM. In this research, to replicate the real wind blow, two different fans are used: a. 71 cm diameter industrial fan with range of wind speed from 1 to 6 m/s; b. 31 cm fan with a range of wind speed from 1 to 4,5 m/s. From the result, it can be concluded that the direction of the wind affects the rotation of the rotor, so it must be ensured that the wind touches the tip of the blade to maximize the rotational speed. The maximum voltage output produced by VAWT is 4,8 V at 67 RPM on wind speed 6 m/s using the 1st Generator. For further development, the Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT) have to be remodelled so the ratio between rotor radius and rotor height is 1,2. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Flow Simulation; Low Rpm Generator; Savonius; Toll Road; Vertical Axis Wind Turbine; Coal Deposits; Energy Policy; Energy Utilization; Industrial Research; Population Statistics; Proven Reserves; Wind Power; Wind Turbines; Energy Source; Fossil Energy; Indonesia; Low Rpm Generator; Renewable Energies; Savonii; Small Scale; Vertical Axes Wind Turbines; Wind Blows; Wind Speed; Wind","Coal deposits; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Industrial research; Population statistics; Proven reserves; Wind power; Wind turbines; Energy source; Fossil energy; Indonesia; Low RPM generator; Renewable energies; Savonii; Small scale; Vertical axes wind turbines; Wind blows; Wind speed; Wind","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127470919"

However, its lower performance remains a major problem due to high unproductive torque produced by the returning blade. In this paper, an optimum blade profile is obtained by maximizing the power coefficient (CP) considering the overlap ratio (OR) as an optimization parameter. This is done by coupling computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation to the rotor blade profile developed through the simplex search method. The blade profile is symmetric about the x-axis, where half of the blade geometry is formed by a natural cubic spline curve using three points. Two end points are retained fixed, while x and y of the third point is taken as a variable in addition to OR in the simplex search process throughout its iteration using the MATLAB platform. In all the iterations, the blade profile is meshed by using ANSYS ICEM CFD platform. The rotor performance analysis is carried out by ANSYS Fluent using the shear-stress transport (SST) k-ω turbulence model. The finite volume method (FVM) is used as a solver setup to solve the transient 2D flow around the rotor blade. The optimum blade profile is compared to a conventional semicircular blade profile over a wide range of tip speed ratio (TSR). The present study demonstrates the superior performance of the optimum blade profile showing CPmax that is 23% higher than the conventional semicircular blade profile at TSR = 0.8. Further, at OR = 0.154, the CP is found to be maximum. The velocity magnitude contours, total pressure and turbulence intensity contours are generated to analyse the effect of the optimal design approach. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Optimization; Overlap Ratio; Power Coefficient; Savonius Rotor; Simplex Search Method; Tip Speed Ratio; Vertical Axis Wind Turbine; Computational Fluid Dynamics; Geometry; Global Warming; Iterative Methods; Matlab; Shear Stress; Turbomachine Blades; Turbulence Models; Wind Turbines; Blade Profile; Optimisations; Overlap Ratios; Performance; Power Coefficients; Savonius Rotor; Savonius Wind Rotor; Simplex Search Method; Tip Speed Ratio; Vertical Axes Wind Turbines; Finite Volume Method","Computational fluid dynamics; Geometry; Global warming; Iterative methods; MATLAB; Shear stress; Turbomachine blades; Turbulence models; Wind turbines; Blade profile; Optimisations; Overlap ratios; Performance; Power coefficients; Savonius rotor; Savonius wind rotor; Simplex search method; Tip speed ratio; Vertical axes wind turbines; Finite volume method","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124466486"

Wind energy is one of the most promising renewable technologies with an increasingly important role. Particularly Savonius Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (SVAWT) have several advantages for certain geographical conditions attracting designers to research them. The present study introduces the Response Surface Methodology (RSM) as a tool for evaluating multiple SVAWT configurations and estimating the influence of rotor geometric parameters on SVAWT performance. For this purpose, CFD simulations are developed for different SVAWT configurations modeled parametrically through the rotor geometric parameters. The numerical solutions obtained are used to generate a Response Surface (RS). The RS is evaluated by finding satisfactory quality metrics. The influence of the geometric parameters is estimated using the selected RS. As a result, an experimental space is proposed where it is more likely to find the values in the geometric parameters that maximize the SVAWT performance. This research provides tools for large-scale evaluation of SVAWTs. Therefore, influence analysis of the parameters is carried out with fewer experiments. RSM and proposed experimental space serve as a base for future studies that optimize the SVAWT configuration. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computational Fluid Dynamics; Design Of Experiments; Sensitivity Analysis For Design; Wind Turbine; Climate Change; Computational Fluid Dynamics; Design Of Experiments; Geometry; Parameter Estimation; Quality Control; Sensitivity Analysis; Surface Properties; Wind Power; Energy-consumption; Performance; Renewable Sources; Response Surface; Response-surface Methodology; Savonius Wind Turbine; Sensitivity Analyse For Design; Technology-based; Turbine Performance; Vertical Axes Wind Turbines; Wind Turbines","Climate change; Computational fluid dynamics; Design of experiments; Geometry; Parameter estimation; Quality control; Sensitivity analysis; Surface properties; Wind power; Energy-consumption; Performance; Renewable sources; Response surface; Response-surface methodology; Savonius wind turbine; Sensitivity analyse for design; Technology-based; Turbine performance; Vertical axes wind turbines; Wind turbines","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124457645"

On contrary, vertical axis wind turbines are found to be superior for low wind speed conditions, which are generally found in crowded urban areas. This paper aims to present a design and numerical analysis of a vertical axis wind turbine that can be used in small-scale urban applications like wind trees. Hence in this paper, to absorb maximum wind energy available, we have selected wind tree applications for which three types of vertical axis rotor design are numerically studied. A Computational Fluid Dynamics simulation is performed on three different geometrical configurations: Savonius helical bach rotor, simple Saonius rotor, and simple bach rotor to predict their performance. The coefficient of power, coefficient of moment, and power produced by these three rotors are evaluated. A MATLAB-based Simulink model is developed to evaluate the power produced by these three rotors and results are compared with CFD results for validation purposes. From our study, it can be observed that the helical-type Bach rotor performed better than the other two, simple Saonius rotor and simple bach rotor considered. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cfd Simulations; Energy Harvesting; Savonius Rotors; Vertical Axis Wind Turbine; Computational Fluid Dynamics; Forestry; Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine; Matlab; Vertical Axis Wind Turbine; Wind Power; Wind Speed; Cfd Simulations; Horizontal-axis Wind Turbines; Low Wind Speed; Peer Review; Performance; Power; Savonius Rotor; Simple++; Sustainable Materials; Vertical Axes Wind Turbines; Energy Harvesting","Computational fluid dynamics; Forestry; Horizontal axis wind turbine; MATLAB; Vertical axis wind turbine; Wind power; Wind speed; CFD simulations; Horizontal-axis wind turbines; Low wind speed; Peer review; Performance; Power; Savonius rotor; Simple++; Sustainable materials; Vertical axes wind turbines; Energy harvesting","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123399730"

Most of the studies conducted so far have focused on the evaluation of torque and power coefficients (CT, CP) of the rotor. This paper aims at analyzing the aerodynamic drag and lift coefficients (CD, CL) of a Savonius rotor blade profile that is generated by the simplex search method to maximize its CP. The optimization is carried out by coupling the numerical simulations with the simplex search method. The optimized blade profile thus obtained is symmetric about its axis, where one half is created through a natural cubic spline curve using three points. Two-dimensional (2D) unsteady numerical simulations have been conducted by adopting ANSYS FLUENT solver to examine the CD and CL of the optimized blade profile at an inlet air velocity of 7.30 m/s. The shear stress transport (SST) k- turbulence model is used to solve the transient Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations. The aerodynamic analysis is performed over a range of tip speed ratios (TSRs). The total pressure, velocity magnitudes, and the turbulent intensity contours of the optimized blade profile are generated and studied at different angles of rotation. The CD and CL of the blade profile are investigated for a complete rotation with an increment of 1. At TSR = 0.8, the optimized profile shows a CDmax of 1.91 at an angle of rotation of 54, while CDmin is found to be 0.45 at an angle 147. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blade Profiles; Cfd Simulations; Lift And Drag Coefficients; Power Coefficient; Savonius Rotor; Simplex Search Technique; Tip-speed Ratio; Aerodynamic Drag; Air; Computational Fluid Dynamics; Curve Fitting; Lift; Navier Stokes Equations; Numerical Methods; Numerical Models; Shear Flow; Shear Stress; Turbomachine Blades; Blade Profile; Cfd Simulations; Lift And Drag Coefficients; Power Coefficients; Rotor Blades; Savonius Rotor; Search Technique; Simplex Search; Simplex Search Technique; Tip Speed Ratio; Turbulence Models","Aerodynamic drag; Air; Computational fluid dynamics; Curve fitting; Lift; Navier Stokes equations; Numerical methods; Numerical models; Shear flow; Shear stress; Turbomachine blades; Blade profile; CFD simulations; Lift and drag coefficients; Power coefficients; Rotor blades; Savonius rotor; Search technique; Simplex search; Simplex search technique; Tip speed ratio; Turbulence models","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122381408"

It is a drag-driven device where the pressure of the fluid stagnating within its blades results in its rotation. The high starting torque and poor operational efficiency of this type of turbine rotor are its distinguishing features. The main geometric and flow parameters that influence its performance are its blade profile, overlap ratio, aspect ratio and Reynolds number (Re). Among these parameters, the blade profile influences significantly on the power production. Recent studies have shown that, choice of an elliptic blade can help in harnessing more wind energy, however, it is desirable to characterize this choice through detailed studies. The present study aims at evaluating the performance of a two-elliptical-bladed Savonius turbine rotor for its dynamic torque and power characteristics. In order to characterize its performances, the developed rotor is experimented in an open circuit low speed wind tunnel. The experiments have been carried out at different Re values so as to estimate the dependence of rotor performance on Re.

Coefficient of power is defined as the ratio of power generated by the turbine to the total power available to the turbine from the free-flowing wind. This is synonymous to the operational efficiency of the wind turbine. Coefficient of torque reflects the torque generating ability of the turbine. In this manuscript, experiments have been performed using three different types of rotor profiles for Savonius-style wind turbines (SSWTs) namely, classical SSWT, Benesh type SSWT and elliptical shaped SSWT using oriented jets. Using deflector plates the orientation of jets have been varied from 20O to 70O. Addition of deflector plates to the wind turbines, assists in maximizing the utilization of wind energy. Experiments have been performed in the laminar air flow. Mechanical loads have been used to study Coefficient of performance (CP) and coefficient of torque (CT) as a function of tip speed ratio (TSRs). The velocity of the wind is adjusted by varying the rheostat that controls the AC motor for the wind tunnel systems. Experimental results indicated that optimum performance could be achieved from all three types of SSWT variants at TSR ~ 0.70. Out of the three designs studied in this manuscript, elliptic shaped SWT yielded best coefficient of performance equal to 0.39 at TSR = 0.70. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Coefficient Of Performance; Savinous-style Wind Turbine; Semi-elliptic Design; Vertical Axis Wind Turbine; Wind Energy; Ac Motors; Torque; Wind Power; Wind Tunnels; Coefficient Of Performance; Coefficient Of Power; Coefficient Of Torques; Comparatives Studies; Power; Savinoi-style Wind Turbine; Semi-elliptic Design; Tip Speed Ratio; Total Power; Vertical Axes Wind Turbines; Wind Turbines","AC motors; Torque; Wind power; Wind tunnels; Coefficient of Performance; Coefficient of power; Coefficient of torques; Comparatives studies; Power; Savinoi-style wind turbine; Semi-elliptic design; Tip speed ratio; Total power; Vertical axes wind turbines; Wind turbines","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122350101"

Genetic algorithm has been used to optimize design variables having distinct values and discontinuous and nondifferentiable objective functions. Optimization procedure using genetic algorithm uses the following steps: initialization, assessment, assortment, crossover and lastly alteration. Once the genetic algorithm is initialized, then the evaluation process trails, where each parametric value is evaluated based on the fitness function stated as objective function. Then the GA operators i.e assortment, cross over and alteration are applied. At the end of GA operation procedure, a new set of values of design parameter is generated. This procedure is endlessly iterated until the convergence criteria is met. Then the optimized and non-optimized profiles are studied using numerical simulation. Initially a two-dimensional numerical model is developed and validated against experimental results. The two-dimensional analysis is conducted using k- shear stress transport model. Unsteady Reynold's Averaged Navier Stoke's equations have been solved to simulate the flow field of a Savonius-style rotor. This analysis has been executed using finite volume approach in Fluent 17.2 version. Grid independence study is performed to curtail the effect of grid size on the flow field portrayals. The optimization technique implemented on the Savonius-style wind turbine, generated design parameters that were able to yield a coefficient of performance value of 0.398.

In the recent times, significant research activities are carried out in the renewable energy field, mostly in solar and wind power generation. Wind turbines are categorised into vertical axis wind turbines (VAWT) and horizontal axis wind turbines (HAWT). Savonius rotor (S-type) is a type of VAWT and its function depends on the drag force. It has many advantages of easy installation, simplicity in design, good self-starting capability, low speeds operation and independency of direction of wind. Although, the negative torque produced on the returning blade leads to its low efficiency. Researchers have conducted several investigations to improve the functioning of Savonius rotor for satisfying large-scale energy demands. The parameters affecting the performance, such as, overlap ratio, aspect ratio, tip speed ratio and blade shapes, are improved by undergoing various designs. Several augmentation techniques, such as, end plates, shielding obstacle, guide box tunnel, deflecting plate, curtain plate, quarter blades and nozzles, have been used to enhance the performance of S-type VAWT. With the installation of these augmentation devices, the negative torque acting on the blades was reduced and the starting ability of the rotor was improved. These devices in turn help in increasing the power output as well as the torque coefficient of various rotor configurations. It has been reported in the literature that the coefficient of power of the conventional Savonius rotor lies in the span of 0.12 to 0.18. By using different methods for optimizing its design or installing the augmentation devices, the coefficient of performance can be improved to a value of 0.52. In this article various performance influencing parameters and the power augmentation techniques used for S-type VAWT have been studied and reported studies on these techniques have been reviewed. The article concludes with proposed directions for future research. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Augmentation Techniques; Overlap Ratio; Power Coefficient; Savonius Rotor; Tip Speed Ratio; Aspect Ratio; Drag; Electric Power Generation; Energy Policy; Global Warming; Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine; Vertical Axis Wind Turbine; Wind Turbine Blades; Augmentation Techniques; Design Enhancement; Negative Torques; Overlap Ratios; Performance; Power Coefficients; Savonius Rotor; Savonius Wind Turbine; Tip Speed Ratio; Vertical Axes Wind Turbines; Wind Power","Aspect ratio; Drag; Electric power generation; Energy policy; Global warming; Horizontal axis wind turbine; Vertical axis wind turbine; Wind turbine blades; Augmentation techniques; Design enhancement; Negative torques; Overlap ratios; Performance; Power coefficients; Savonius rotor; Savonius wind turbine; Tip speed ratio; Vertical axes wind turbines; Wind power","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117686656"

However, the conversion efficiency of the conventional single-rotor wind turbine (SRWT) is still far from satisfactory. The dual-rotor counter-rotating concept is among the reliable techniques used to enhance the efficiency of a wind energy conversion device for its renowned effectiveness. This study aims to investigate the performance of a Savonius dual/twin-rotor system, particularly in low-speed wind conditions while employing the counter-rotating technique. The evaluation of this technique is presented in terms of aerodynamic characteristics, including the power and torque coefficients. The results have shown that the new concept was able to improve the performance of the system extensively and was capable of operating in a lower wind speed condition. Compared to a single-rotor system, an additional 42% more torque was possible owing to the existence of a second rotor in the new system. The results have also revealed that the conversion efficiency of the system has been enhanced substantially. A corresponding average power coefficient of up to 28% was achieved. The present technique is thought to be promising for wind energy conversion systems, including sites with poor wind conditions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Counter-rotating Technique; Low-speed Wind; Savonius Rotor; Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (vawt); Wind Turbine Design","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115927872"

Most of the optimization is done by modifying the shape of the blade. The Bach-type blades have a simple model with excellent performance. The challenge for designing Bach–type blade is the specific size of the radius circular arc of the blade. This is the reason why most of the optimization is done through simulation. In this article, the authors propose a new approach for designing the radius circular for Bach–type blade by using the Myring equation where the parameter control for the radius can be easily adjusted by θ. The three different values of θ combined with three different blades number are tested experimentally in order to obtain the best turbine model. Data from experiment is analyzed to obtain the CP for each model showing that the highest CP is achieved by three-bladed rotor with θ=10°. Furthermore, the minimum and the maximum value of θ as parameter control are discussed and they can be used as a good reference for further development of Bach-type blades for the Savonius turbine. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bach-type; Coefficient Power; Myring Equation; Parameter Control Θ; Savonius Turbine","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115336898"

The rotation rate of this rotor is considerably lower than that of horizontal axis wind turbines and Darrieus wind turbines. However, it starts rotating at small wind speeds, doesn't require any additional devices to ensure its re-orientation in case of change of the wind direction, and generates a rather large torque. Therefore, it is suitable for use as a drive in different mechanical and electromechanical systems. In the present paper, dynamics of rectilinear motion of a wheeled cart is studied, which is driven by Savonius rotor installed on it. It is assumed that the wind makes a certain constant angle with the line, along which the cart moves. The aerodynamic load upon the rotor is described with an empirical model, in the context of which the aerodynamic characteristics (aerodynamic torque, drag and lateral force coefficients) are represented as Fourier series with respect to the rotor revolution angle, the coefficients of the series being functions of the rotor tip speed ratio (dimensionless angular speed). Experiments were performed in the subsonic wind tunnel of the Institute of Mechanics of Lomonosov Moscow State University intended to measure aerodynamic characteristics of the rotor at different wind speeds and rotor angular speeds. Based on experimental data, functions were proposed that approximately describe the dependence of the above mentioned coefficients upon the tip speed ratio. The obtained dependences were used for analysis of dynamics of the cart driven by the Savonius rotor. The equations of motion are averaged with respect to the angle of revolution of rotor. Steady solutions of this averaged system are studied. It is shown that, for certain values of parameters, there exist two attracting steady motions corresponding to different directions of the cart velocity. Cart dynamics in the context of the full system of equations of motion is compared with its dynamics in the context of the averaged system. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dynamics; Mathematical Model; Savonius Rotor; Steady Motions; Wheeled Vehicle","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107022537"

The Savonius turbine could be a type of vertical axis wind turbine of choice for power production and off-grid application, allowing exploitation in confined spaces and areas with low wind speed. This research aims to improve the performance efficiency of Savonius elliptical turbines by developing parameters of blade shape and overlap ratio. A series of 2D unsteady simulations (CFD-Fluent version 19.1) with using k-? SST (Shear-stress transport) model of the classical Savonius elliptical turbine (Model-2) was performed by improving the overlap ratio of the rotor. Classical elliptical Savonius turbine was modified by changing the overlap ratio from the value (0.1, 0.15, and 0.2). Then, modifying the inner surface of the blade in the concave part and it into a regular zigzag shape (Model-1), and testing the models in an open wind tunnel system. As the result of the 2D simulation of Model-2 at OR=0.2 the increase value of the obtained maximum power coefficient is 3% and 5.54% compared to the overlap ratio (0.15 and 0.1), respectively.

For this the performances of a two-bladed Savonius rotor, a three bladed Savonius rotor, and a hybrid two-bladed Savonius and three-bladed H-rotor (H-Savonius rotor) are analyzed at four different wind velocities (7.5, 8.5, 10.5 and 12.5 m/s).

The two-bladed Savonius rotor is then attached with the H-rotor having unsymmetrical S818 airfoil blades for which the maximum power coefficient of the hybrid turbine is creased to 0.197. The exergy efficiency of the H-Savonius rotor is found higher than any other rotor, which is increased by 8.5% compared to the two-bladed Savonius rotor and which is also higher than published result.

Amongst the various kinds of renewable resources, wind energy is one of the most preferable due to its abundant availability, lesser cost, zero emission compared to other sources. Amongst the various kind of vertical axis wind turbines (VAWT), H-Darrieus rotor is more popular in the built environment for their simple constructions and higher power coefficient which also suffers from poor self-starting features. Again, the Savonius rotor is having the good self-starting ability but possess lesser power coefficient. To address all such limitations, existing investigations of hybrid H-Savonius rotor have been reported here in terms of the design, various parameters and aerodynamic performances which are used to improve their self-starting and efficiency. From this study, it is seen that the coaxial arrangement of the H-Savonius rotor is capable to exhibit higher efficiency and better self-starting characteristics than the staging assembly or the individual Savonius or H-rotor. Again, a newly designed hybrid H-Savonius rotor exhibits the maximum power coefficient of 0.414 at TSR2.5. Modification of the Savoniusblade and thicker H-rotor airfoil blade helps to increase the efficiency of the hybrid rotor.

The amount of energy consumption has become the indicator for the standard of living and the degree of industrialization. People use fossil fuels to meet nearly all of their energy needs, such as powering vehicles, producing electricity for light and heat and running factories, thus greatly exhausting the fossil fuel reserves along with polluting the environment with greenhouse gases. Renewable energy sources are viable alternatives, and among the various types of renewable energy sources available, wind energy is the sector which has a lot of untapped potential. Our objective is to improve the efficiency of a Savonius-type vertical-axis wind turbine (VAWT) which currently has the least efficiency among existing wind turbine designs. Savonius turbines have a very compact structure and can run at low wind speeds which are desirable characteristics for commercial-scale power production. This research paper focuses on improving the efficiency of Savonius wind turbine. Since Savonius-type wind turbines are drag-based wind turbines, we need to reduce the impulsive force acting on the negative face in order to increase the drag difference between the positive and negative side of the rotor blades thereby improving the efficiency of the turbine. Our proposition for attaining higher efficiency is by incorporating the concept of dimples (inspired from golf ball) on the negative side of the rotor blade and tubercles (inspired from whales) on the leading edge of the rotor blade. Dimples reduce the amount of wake region in the case of golf ball by increasing turbulence which is one of the desirable characteristics in the case of Savonius wind turbine. Tubercles help in reducing the wake region behind the rotor blades by increasing the turbulence of air near the surface of the rotor thereby improving the efficiency of the turbine. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dimples; Drag Based; Savonius; Tubercles; Vawt; Wake Region","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85093889577"

A rarely researched field regarding VAWT is on analyzing the effects of various input velocities for bidirectional wind flow on the vertical axis wind turbines due to the complex and unsteady wind flow characteristics. In the current study, three-dimensional simulations are carried out, and the static and dynamic results are then reported for different values of rotational speed. The outcomes like output velocities and pressure are analyzed for a range of input velocities in a Savonius wind turbine. Different input velocities in the range of 10 m/s, 15 m/s, 20 m/s and 25 m/s were studied. The model for the rotor was designed on Solidworks 2018, and numerical analysis was carried out for a bidirectional wind input on commercial CFD software, ANSYS Fluent v16.0.

There is a major concern growing in the world for substituting fossil fuel by renewable energy to cut off the emissions. Energy extracted from the wind can be classified into high power and low power energy. Savonius wind turbine can produce energy from poor wind conditions. Savonius wind rotor has many advantages over others in that its construction is simpler and cheaper. It is independent of the wind direction and has a good starting torque at lower wind speeds.

For hydrokinetic turbine there is no need to construct the dam across the river or canal for storing the water to gene rate the power. Energy of flowing water stream is directly used to generate the power. It is advantageous in comparison to other renewable resources because it does not generate greenhouse gases. In India there are very less number of operating hydrokine tic energy plants, there are thousands of canals and enormous prospective for tapping hydrokinetic energy. Savonius hydrokinetic turbine is a vertical axis turbine which can be used in low stream velocity like river stream or canals. The present work deals with the performance improvement of savonius hydrokinetic turbine by changing the profiles of its turbine blades. A 3 bladed savonius hydrokinetic turbine having aspect ratio of 5.35 is designed and modeled in CREO 3.0. In order to study the performance of savonius turbine ANSYS FLUENT 16.1 is used. The behavior of the flow distribution in rotor has been analyzed and discussed in this investigation. Rotor is simulated for various rotational speeds and flow stream velocities. Three different blade profiles i.e, NACA 63(3)018, NACA 6409, NACA 4412 are investigated for their performance. The results obtained from numerical simulation of existing hydro kinetic turbine with turbine blades of NACA 63(3)018 profile are validated with the experimental results. It is found that the existing profile of this turbine can be replaced by NACA 6409 for getting better performance. The maximum value of power coefficient Cp for profile NACA 6409 is 0.5, for tip speed ratio (TSR) of 0.7. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blade Profile; Cfd; Hydrokinetic Turbine; Squirrel Cage Darrius Turbine","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096603847"

Yet, there exits few experimental investigations from literature that have been carried to explain this effect. This could be attributable to huge wind tunneling cost requirement and an array of design skills required including time constrains. The balance between cost and power performance has limited development of VAWTs towards utility scale type. In this paper therefore, we seek to investigate in detail the performance characteristics of vertical axis wind rotors in a wind tunnel environment. The H-Darrieus and Savonius-type VAWT configurations have been utilized to carry out the investigation. A systematic analysis of effect of blade number, rotor configuration, and flow regime including comparison of the two configurations was presented to predict the power performance using a rotary sensor. Results revealed a significant impact of flow field regime on power performance of the VAWT models, with the Savonius-type rotor attaining lower power coefficient (C<inf>P</inf>) than the Darrieus-type rotor across all the tested wind speeds. In addition, increase in number of blades for Darrieus-type rotor revealed narrower negative C<inf>P</inf> band that decreased with increase in wind speeds. In both configurations, the C<inf>P</inf> decreased at low tip speed ratios while an increase in C<inf>P</inf> was revealed at high tip speed ratios. The understanding gained from the results could be useful to the VAWT research community, and the findings can be extended to the design of wind turbines for mini-grid and utility scale applications. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Flow Regime; Power Coefficient; Rotor Configuration; Vawt; Wind Tunnel","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85095428879"

Assessment methods based on the flow field characterizations, the variation of torque and power coefficient are performed. Thus, transient simulations using the SST k–ω turbulence model are carried out. The numerical model is validated using wind tunnel tests.

The main purpose of this study is to improve the extraction capabilities of a single-rotor VAWT by using two distinct rotor designs while adopting the counter-rotating technique. Given that the conversion capabilities and operational speed of the existing wind turbines are still limited, the current technique is used to enhance the efficiency and expand the operating wind speed range of the VAWT. The Darrius and Savonius counter-rotating rotors were exposed to a similar upstream wind speed using a centrifugal blower. It was found that the Savonius-Darrius counter-rotating rotor was able to operate effectively, particularly at the low-speed wind. By looking at the individual performance of the rotors, it was observed that the conversion efficiency of the H-type rotor increases as the wind speed increases. However, in the case of the S-type rotor, it is higher at lower wind speed and tends to decrease as the operating speed increases. Thus, the maximum efficiency of the S-type rotor was achieved at low speed, whereas the H-type rotor has achieved its maximum efficiency at the highest operating wind speed. The average efficiency of the present Savonius-Darrius counter-rotating rotor has been improved to reach almost 42% and 30% more efficiency in terms of torque and power, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Counter-rotating Concept; Darrius Rotor; Performance Evaluation; Savonius Rotor; Efficiency; Speed; Wind Turbines; Average Efficiencies; Counter Rotating; Counter-rotating Technique; Extraction Capability; Individual Performance; Performance Evaluation; Savonius Rotor; Vertical Axis Wind Turbines; Wind","Efficiency; Speed; Wind turbines; Average efficiencies; Counter rotating; Counter-rotating technique; Extraction capability; Individual performance; performance evaluation; Savonius rotor; Vertical axis wind turbines; Wind","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073955518"

In addition to energy harvesting, the GreenValve configuration also has the function of fluid regulating, which makes a qualitative breakthrough in both structure and function. However, the runner specially used to match the ball valve has not been fully studied and designed. Hence, based on the traditional Savonius rotor, a modified semi-elliptical runner is proposed in this study. To better match the ball valve structurally, the roundness of the runner at blade tip position is improved and, thus, the initial runner configuration is obtained. Moreover, research on blade profile flatness and runner aspect ratio is conducted in FLUENT software to be more functionally compatible with the ball valve. Numerical results indicate that the GreenValve always performs best in terms of shaft power at 25% opening regardless of the aspect ratio and the flatness. When the flatness value is equal to 0.7, the GreenValve presents the maximum shaft power and the second highest flow coefficient which is only 1.9% lower than the maximum value. Comparison results of three models with different aspect ratios reveal that the model with the smallest aspect ratio has a slight reduction in flow capacity while a significant improvement in shaft power, reaching a maximum shaft power of 78.6W. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Control Valve; Energy Harvesting; Hydraulic Turbine; Savonius Rotor; Water Supply System; Detection Method; Equipment; Equipment Component; Integrated Approach; Performance Assessment; Elagatis","detection method; equipment; equipment component; integrated approach; performance assessment; Elagatis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092898926"

For this purpose, an airfoil-shaped deflector was proposed and placed in front of the turbine to prevent the negative torque affecting the convex surface of the returning blade and also making it possible for deflecting the wind into the advancing blade. Different configurations of the proposed deflector system were considered numerically using the CFD solver. A three-dimensional incompressible unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulation in conjunction with the SST k − ω turbulence model was done and validated with the available experimental data. The predicted results indicated that the performance of the Savonius rotor is highly dependent on the position and angle of the deflector. Thus, there was an appropriate position and angle values to obtain the highest torque and power coefficients.

It has a good starting capacity and an insensitivity to wind direction. It works relatively at low wind speed in an easy installation. Savonius wind turbine faces major drawbacks, including some of the low efficiency and high negative torque created by the returning blade. Many attempts have been undertaken to optimize the blade’s shape to increase the performance of these wind turbines. The vertical axis is still under development. The elliptical-blades with a cut angle equal 47.50° have recently shown enhanced performance. In this study, we investigate the effect of Elliptical-bladed multistage Savonius Rotors (rotor aspect ratio, stage aspect ratio) on the performance by means of numerical simulation. The results obtained by comparison of one, two, and three-stage rotors indicate that the maximum power coefficient increase with a number of the stages (for the rotors with similar RAR of 0.7).

This is based on the construction which is an upright axis wind turbine so that it has a large initial torque rotation at low wind velocity. The large torque produced comes from the flexibility of the turbine blade in receiving wind from all directions. Such conditions make Savonius wind turbine blades have great potential to be engineered to produce the best performance. One form of engineering is by adding a deflector between the outer blades slits. Therefore, this study aims to analyze and obtain the value of Savonius wind turbine output power overlapping with the definition of deflector on the lower rotor and the variation of the effective angle of the upper rotor. This research is quantitative with the true-experimental method. The steps began with the creation of research objects such as the Savonius wind turbines and the search for other equipment such as gearboxes, generators and LED lights. Then the object will be given the title of artificial wind fluid from the blower to determine the performance of the wind turbine. Based on the results of the study it can be seen that the position of the deflector angle of 45° and the effective angle of 20°, 40°, 60° produced the highest output power value reaching 2.6544 Watts and the torque value reaching 118,997 Nm.

Each wave crest transmits 10-50 kW/m of energy, which is 15-20 times higher than wind or solar energies. The availability of wave energy is 90% compared to 30% for wind and solar energies. The oscillating water column (OWC), which is the most investigated wave energy converter consists of a partially submerged hollow structure positioned either vertically or inclined. The bidirectional airflow above the water column drives a turbine. The conventional OWCs experience flow separation at the sharp corners of the chamber. To address this issue, researchers have proposed inclining the chamber at an angle with respect to the incident waves to improve the flow characteristics. In the present work, the effect of OWC inclination on rotor performance is studied using the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code ANSYS-CFX. The results highlight that the 55 deg inclined OWC showed improved performance compared to the conventional OWC and modified OWC (optimized in a previous work). The maximum power for the inclined OWC was 13% higher than that for the rotor in the modified OWC and 28% than that in the conventional OWC at mean wave condition. The 55 deg inclined OWC recorded peak rotor power of 23.2 kW with an efficiency of 27.6% at the mean sea state.

Two shapes of H-Darrieus airfoils were investigated, which were the symmetric NACA-0018 airfoil and the asymmetric NACA-2415 airfoil. Both configurations were tested on varying tip speed ratios of 0.5 to 4 and wind velocities of 4 m/sec and 7 m/sec. Unsteady, two-dimensional numerical simulations were performed. A moving mesh was applied for the rotating part. The simulation was carried out by using a shear stress transport (SST), ±k-ω turbulent model. From the simulation results, the flow contours, coefficient of moment and coefficient of power are extracted. It is found that at the optimum TSR of 2.75, the maximum ±bC±P extracted for the hybrid turbine with the NACA-2415 profile is 36.62% and 40.9%, at a wind speed of 4 m/sec and 7 m/sec, respectively. Meanwhile, the hybrid turbine with the NACA-0018 profile has the maximum ±C±P of 35.14% (optimum TSR of 2.75) and 37.42% (optimum TSR of 2.5) at wind speeds of 4 m/sec and 7 m/sec, respectively. Furthermore, the minimum value of the coefficient of moment for varying azimuth angle is approximately zero, suggesting better self-starting capability of the hybrid turbine. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","H-darrieus Rotor; Hybrid Darrieus-savonius; Numerical Simulation; Self-starting; Vawt; Airfoils; Intelligent Systems; Numerical Models; Shear Stress; Wind; Wind Turbines; Coefficient Of Power; Electrical Energy; High Power Efficiencies; Mechanical Energies; Residential Areas; Shear-stress Transport; Two-dimensional Numerical Simulation; Vertical Axial Wind Turbines; Turbomachine Blades","Airfoils; Intelligent systems; Numerical models; Shear stress; Wind; Wind turbines; Coefficient of power; Electrical energy; High power efficiencies; Mechanical energies; Residential areas; Shear-stress transport; Two-dimensional numerical simulation; Vertical axial wind turbines; Turbomachine blades","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091706508"

Solar-wind has become an independent, sustainable and clean energy solution, yet, this has not been adopted in many countries. This energy is estimated to overcome the demand of power in the future because of its ability to produce several megawatts of power with zero emission. The aim of this study is to design and develop a hybrid wind and solar energy generation which can increase the electrical energy’s efficiency by using the wind turbine and solar panels. The implemented system aims at providing an amplified alternative source of renewable energy to cater for the already diminishing, pollutant and scarce traditional fuels such as oil, gas and coal. The implemented hybrid design consists of an improved design for the VAWT (Vertical Axis Wind Turbine), whereby two VAWT designs i.e. cup shaped and Savonius are compared in terms of performance and efficiency. The system also consists of two solar panels which are used to supplement the power generated especially during hot days when the wind speed is low. The experimental results show that the proposed system is able to generate a maximum power of 75.05W and a minimum power of 18.2W. However, in order to achieve these results a PMSG (Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator) design from a recycled stepper motor is proposed in this research and implemented with a total number of 9 copper wound coils for the stator and by using rare earth magnets for the rotor (shaft). © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Electricity Generation; Hybrid System; Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generation; Renewable Energy; Solar Energy; Solar Panel; Solar-wind; Wind Energy; Wind Turbine","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091458421"

The Magnus force formed due to the autorotation of Savonius rotors creates a momentum supporting the rotation of the central turbine shaft. The main difference of this study from earlier investigations in this area is as follows: we take into account the variation of the blade width along the radius. In our model, the conical Savonius rotor is replaced by a pair of cylindrical rotors with different diameters, which provides the possibility to use the experimental force-momentum characteristics, taking into account the substantial variations of the velocity field along the blade’s radius. In the model, we consider the possibility to control the value of the external electric resistance in the local circuit of the unit generator. We describe the dependence of the mechanical power on the parameters of the model and construct a control strategy providing the possibility to maintain the power close to the maximum possible value under changes in the wind velocity. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Velocity; Wind Power; Wind Turbines; Control Strategies; Dynamics And Control; Horizontal Axis; Mechanical Power; Substantial Variations; Unit Generator; Velocity Field; Wind Velocities; Turbomachine Blades","Velocity; Wind power; Wind turbines; Control strategies; Dynamics and control; Horizontal axis; Mechanical power; Substantial variations; Unit generator; Velocity field; Wind velocities; Turbomachine blades","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090267673"

Numerous investigations were carried out to face this problem. In the present paper, a new idea of the Savonius turbine with a variable geometry of blades is proposed. Its blades, made of elastic material, were continuously deformed during the rotor revolution to increase a positive torque of the advancing blade and to decrease a negative torque of the returning blade. In order to assess the turbine aerodynamic performance, a two-dimensional numerical model was developed. The fluid-structure interaction (FSI) method was applied where blade deformations were defined by computational solid mechanics (CSM) simulations, whereas computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations allowed for transient flow prediction. The influence of the deformation magnitude and the position of maximally deformed blades with respect to the incoming wind direction were studied. The aerodynamic performance increased with an increase in the deformation magnitude. The power coefficient exceeded Cp = 0.30 for the eccentricity magnitude of 10% and reached 0.39 for the highest magnitude under study. It corresponded to 90% improvement in comparison to Cp = 0.21 in the case of the fixed-shape Savonius turbine. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blade Load; Computational Fluid Dynamics (cfd); Deformable Blades; Fluid-structure Interaction (fsi); Power Coefficient; Savonius Turbine; Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (vawt); Aerodynamics; Computational Fluid Dynamics; Deformation; Fluid Structure Interaction; Aero-dynamic Performance; Computational Fluid Dynamics Simulations; Computational Solid Mechanics; Deformation Magnitude; Numerical Investigations; Savonius Wind Turbine; Turbine Aerodynamics; Two Dimensional Numerical Models; Turbomachine Blades","Aerodynamics; Computational fluid dynamics; Deformation; Fluid structure interaction; Aero-dynamic performance; Computational fluid dynamics simulations; Computational solid mechanics; Deformation magnitude; Numerical investigations; Savonius wind turbine; Turbine aerodynamics; Two dimensional numerical models; Turbomachine blades","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089817818"

Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT) is the best option for small wind turbine project and suitable for low average wind speed environment. In this project, experiment had been carried out to study the effect of wind blade number on the Savonius wind turbine performance at different wind speeds and a comparison had been made to choose the best performance between 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 blades wind turbine. A small Savonius wind turbine prototype, PicoScope, Digital Anemometer, Digital Tachometer and other equipment were used for this purpose. A PicoScope software with a hardware device had been used to create an oscilloscope and spectrum analyser on the PC. The experiment was carried out in an open room space to acquire a close condition to the real environment.

Design/methodology/approach: Incompressible unsteady reynolds-averaged navier-stokes (URANS) approach using gamma–theta turbulence model is conducted to obtain the time accurate turbulent flow field. The Ffowcs Williams and Hawkings (FW-H) acoustic analogy formulation is used for noise predictions at optimal tip speed ratio (TSR). Findings: The mean torque and power coefficients are compared with the experimental data and acceptable agreement is observed. The total and Mono+Dipole noise graphs are presented. A discrete tonal component at low frequencies in all graphs is attributed to the blade passing frequency at the given TSR. According to the noise prediction results, Bach type rotor has the lowest level of noise emission. The effect of TSR on the noise level from the Bach rotor is investigated. A direct relation between angular velocity and the noise emission is found. Practical implications: The savonius rotor is a type of vertical axis wind turbines suited for mounting in the vicinity of residential areas. Also, wind turbines wherein operation are efficient sources of tonal and broadband noises and affect the inhabitable environment adversely. Therefore, the acoustic pollution assessment is essential for the installation of wind turbines in residential areas. Originality/value: This study aims to investigate the radiated noise level of four common Savonius rotor blade profiles, namely, Bach type, Benesh type, semi-elliptic and conventional. As stated above, numbers of studies exploit the URANS method coupled with the FW-H analogy to predict the aeroacoustics behavior of wind turbines. Therefore, this approach is chosen in this research to deal with the aeroacoustics and aerodynamic calculation of the flow field around the aforementioned Savonius blade profiles. The effect of optimal TSR on the emitted noise and the contribution of thickness, loading and quadrupole sources are of interest in this study. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aeroacoustics; Cfd; Fw-h Acoustic Analogy; Savonius Rotor; Vertical Axis Wind Turbines; Acoustic Emission Testing; Acoustic Emissions; Acoustic Noise; Aeroacoustics; Aerodynamics; Flow Fields; Forecasting; Housing; Navier Stokes Equations; Numerical Models; Turbine Components; Turbomachine Blades; Turbulence Models; Turbulent Flow; Wind Turbine Blades; Acoustic Analogy; Blade Profile; Ffowcs William And Hawking Acoustic Analogy; Noise Emissions; Noise Predictions; Rotor Blades; Savonius Rotor; Tip Speed Ratio; Vertical Axes Wind Turbines; Williams; Computational Fluid Dynamics","Acoustic emission testing; Acoustic emissions; Acoustic noise; Aeroacoustics; Aerodynamics; Flow fields; Forecasting; Housing; Navier Stokes equations; Numerical models; Turbine components; Turbomachine blades; Turbulence models; Turbulent flow; Wind turbine blades; Acoustic analogy; Blade profile; Ffowcs william and hawking acoustic analogy; Noise emissions; Noise predictions; Rotor blades; Savonius rotor; Tip speed ratio; Vertical axes wind turbines; Williams; Computational fluid dynamics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067848057"

Its operating principle provides a better understanding of the magneto-piezo-elastic energy conversion. A good arrangement of permanent magnets was demonstrated to be effective for a reduction of the resistance torque to approximately 94.6 mN∙m.

The novelty relies on the blade manufacturing process which is characterized by a 'twisted cut' through the central axis of a hollow cylinder (tube), followed by a partial twisted cut in the range of 90◦. This approach does not require any expensive fabrication process such as blade molding and/or 3D prints, and, therefore, it can potentially mitigate the production costs. The main goal is to investigate the operational parameters and the overall performance of the presented devices, which are currently being operated in atmospheric conditions. For this purpose, three-dimensional simulations have been performed using the open-source CFD library OpenFOAM in order to solve the governing equations and for characterizing the main phenomena involved in the flow pattern. The Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) approach together with the k − ω SST model were employed to reproduce the flow turbulence effects. This model is validated using wind tunnel measurements of the power (C<inf>P</inf>) and torque (C<inf>M</inf>) coefficients from a straight blade Savonius turbine.

The results were compared against the Savonius turbine employed for validating the model. Aerodynamic loads and general wake structure were studied at the optimal operational conditions as well. For the same turbine configurations, the new blade geometry improved the performance by 20-25% (at its optimal TSR), compared to the conventional straight blade Savonius rotor, as well as the reducing torque fluctuation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blade Manufacturing Process; Savonius Rotor; Twisted Blades; Vawt; Vertical Axis Wind Turbines; 3d Printers; Aerodynamics; Computational Fluid Dynamics; Costs; Flow Patterns; Navier Stokes Equations; Wind Tunnels; Aero-dynamic Performance; Atmospheric Conditions; Operational Conditions; Operational Parameters; Reynolds-averaged-navier-stokes Approaches; Savonius Wind Turbine; Three Dimensional Simulations; Wind Tunnel Measurements; Turbomachine Blades","3D printers; Aerodynamics; Computational fluid dynamics; Costs; Flow patterns; Navier Stokes equations; Wind tunnels; Aero-dynamic performance; Atmospheric conditions; Operational conditions; Operational parameters; Reynolds-averaged-navier-stokes approaches; Savonius wind turbine; Three dimensional simulations; Wind tunnel measurements; Turbomachine blades","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083633673"

Thus, the effects of several design parameters including twist angle, overlap ratio, and endplates size ratio, along with the wind velocity on the performance of the Savonius wind turbine are investigated. Novel assessment methods based on flow field characteristics such as streamlines and pressure fields around the Savonius wind turbine are carried out. This is the first contribution to understand how geometrical variables influence the aerodynamic performance of the twisted Savonius rotor. Moreover, the variation of torque, power, thrust, and static torque coefficients are estimated. Thus, a three-dimensional, incompressible unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes model in conjunction with k-ω shear-stress transport turbulence model is developed. The model is numerically simulated and validated using the experimental and numerical data available in literature. Results indicate that the Savonius rotor with a twist angle of 45°, an overlapping ratio of zero, and endplates size ratio of 1.1 attains the highest net output power compared to other designs. It is found that at a wind velocity of 6 m/s, the Savonius rotor achieves a maximum power coefficient of 0.223, and with further increase of the wind velocity to 10 m/s, the power coefficient reaches 0.231. In addition, the current developed design has a positive static torque coefficient at all rotor angles, and consequently, it achieves a high self-starting ability. However, for the conventional (untwisted) design, the maximum attainable power coefficient was found to be 0.174 at an overlapping ratio of 0.15, and equal endplate size ratio. In addition, negative values of the static torque coefficient were observed at a specific range of rotor angles that prevent the self-starting ability. Accordingly, the new twisted rotor design not only enhances the power coefficient but the self-starting ability as well. The findings of the current results provide another direction for researchers and designers to utilize the twisted Savonius wind turbine. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","End Plate; Overlap Ratio; Performance Enhancement; Twisted Savonius Rotor; Wind Velocity; Navier Stokes Equations; Shear Stress; Torque; Turbulence Models; Velocity; Wind; End - Plates; Overlap Ratios; Performance Enhancements; Savonius Rotor; Wind Velocities; Wind Turbines","Navier Stokes equations; Shear stress; Torque; Turbulence models; Velocity; Wind; End - plates; Overlap ratios; Performance enhancements; Savonius rotor; Wind velocities; Wind turbines","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081276751"

The rotors were tested inside a closed-circuit wind tunnel at 10 m/s of air flow velocity (equivalent to 0.57 m/s of water flow velocity) at a Reynolds number of 90200. Two cases were considered in the investigation: a 2-bladed and 3-bladed rotor, each tested without and with a deflector at an angle (δ) of 60°. The performance of the rotors was analyzed in terms of coefficient of power (C<inf>P</inf>) and coefficient of torque (C<inf>T</inf>) with respect to the tip speed ratio (λ). Results showed that the presence of the deflector significantly improved the performance of both rotors. Without any deflector, C<inf>P</inf> for the 3-bladed rotor was slightly lower than that of the 2-bladed rotor. This reduction is caused by a cascading effect on the flows induced by the extra blade. When augmented, C<inf>P</inf> for the 2-bladed and 3-bladed rotors increased by 128.36% and 604.62%, respectively. Such significant improvements, especially on the 3-bladed rotor were attained as the cascading effect on the returning blades reduced. The deflector functioned by shielding the returning blade of the rotor from impinged by the incoming flow. Without any augmentation device, the unobstructed flow would have dragged the blades in the opposing direction and thus reducing the positive torques generated by the rotors.

Under the present work, performance of hybrid rotor cross flow hydrokinetic has been investigated for different rotor parameters. The proposed hybrid rotor is the combination of two conventional turbine rotors (Savonius and Darrieus). Investigations have been performed by considering flow velocity varying in the range from 0.5 m/s to 2.0 m/s. The performance of hybrid rotor was assessed in term of power coefficient (C<inf>P</inf>) and torque coefficient (C<inf>T</inf>). Further, comparison of hybrid rotor and single Darrieus rotor has been carried out on the basis of their performance. Flow behaviour across the turbine vicinity is analyzed and discussed with the pressure, velocity contours and velocity streamlines. It has been found that radius ratio and attachment angle play a crucial role in performance enhancement with reduction in torque fluctuations. For the considered range of rotor parameters, the maximum power coefficient (C<inf>Pmax</inf>) and average torque coefficient (C<inf>Tavg</inf>) were obtained as 0.109 and 0.1276 corresponding to radius ratio of 0.6 at an attachment angle of 90°.

In this regard, the renewable sources, which can provide the sustainable and cleaner energy production, have increasingly become attractive. Hydropower has the highest proportion of the renewable energy sources. Availability and high efficiency are the undeniable advantages of the hydro potentials. In this paper, hydro-energy extraction from pipelines by a new designed vertical axis turbine is studied experimentally and numerically. The turbine scheme is inspired by the Savonius rotor turbine, which includes two semicircular blades that is built by the 3D printer and installed vertically in a 100 mm transparent pipe. A sloped block is used just before the turbine blades to concentrate the flow and enhance the efficiency. In experiments, flow rate ranges from 2.7 × 10−3 m3/s to 7.3 × 10−3 m3/s and pressure drop that occurs through the turbine is less than 10.5 kPa. Numerical results show an acceptable agreement with experiments and assure that numerical method is reliable. Following successful validation, numerical studies are expanded, in order to study more details on the new turbine performance. According to the numerical results, the characteristic curves of the new turbine are depicted and described. In numerical simulation, for different turbine rotational speeds, the flow rate and the pressure difference examined are up to 12 × 10−3 m3/s and 30 kPa, respectively. Using the obtained results, investigations and studies are performed to describe turbine behavior under the effects of changing the clearance and flow field conditions. Finally, cyclic variations of turbine flow rate, torque and minimum pressure on the turbine blade are described by velocities streamlines. This approach might preform design improving for such a turbine. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Experimental Study; In-pipe Water Turbine; Low Head Turbine; Savonius Rotor; Unsteady Numerical Simulation; 3d Printers; Numerical Methods; Numerical Models; Renewable Energy Resources; Rotors; Turbine Components; Experimental Study; Low Head; Savonius Rotor; Unsteady Numerical Simulations; Water Turbines; Turbomachine Blades","3D printers; Numerical methods; Numerical models; Renewable energy resources; Rotors; Turbine components; experimental study; Low head; Savonius rotor; Unsteady numerical simulations; Water turbines; Turbomachine blades","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067878901"

However, the percentage of installations Hydropower in Indonesia is 11.95% which is quite large considering the overall value of the investment. To optimize the water resources, development is needed in terms of hydro-electric power, which one of the well alternatives is the development of the water turbine rotor design. This study aims to determine the effect of adding stages on the performance of the savonius water turbine on the horizontal axis. The research subject will use a one-stage rotor that will be modified into two-stage.

The new technique is based on introducing an upstream deflector and downstream baffle. The shape and location of both devices are optimized using a genetic algorithm. The performance of the turbine with the optimized devices is compared with the single Savonius turbine performance. The study employs the finite volume solver (ANSYS-FLUENT) to solve unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier–Stokes equations and turbulence model equations. The optimized configuration results in much higher power coefficient than the Savonius turbine. The average peak power coefficient using both deflector and baffle is 0.47 compared to 0.24 of the Savonius turbine. The peak power coefficient of the turbine corresponds to a speed ratio close to unity. This improved performance is attributed to the favorable aerodynamic interaction between the turbine and the downstream baffle which accelerates the flow around the rotor and generates larger turning torque. The baffle generates a jet effect on the advancing bucket and accelerates the flow behind the bucket creating a large zone of negative pressure and thereby increases the driving torque. Furthermore, the upstream deflector (also called shield or curtain) produces a shield for the returning bucket of the turbine which diminishes the adverse effect associated with the returning bucket on the aerodynamic torque of the turbine. This remarkable improvement of turbine performance will encourage the future application of the Savonius wind turbine in small power applications of wind energy. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computational Fluid Dynamics; Renewable Energy; Vertical Axis; Wind Energy; Computational Fluid Dynamics; Genetic Algorithms; Navier Stokes Equations; Turbulence Models; Wind Power; Wind Turbines; Aerodynamic Interactions; Augmentation Techniques; Future Applications; Innovative Techniques; Optimized Configuration; Renewable Energies; Savonius Wind Turbine; Vertical Axis; Aerodynamics; Aerodynamics; Alternative Energy; Computational Fluid Dynamics; Innovation; Wind Power; Wind Turbine","Computational fluid dynamics; Genetic algorithms; Navier Stokes equations; Turbulence models; Wind power; Wind turbines; Aerodynamic interactions; Augmentation techniques; Future applications; Innovative techniques; Optimized configuration; Renewable energies; Savonius wind turbine; Vertical axis; Aerodynamics; aerodynamics; alternative energy; computational fluid dynamics; innovation; wind power; wind turbine","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85066861494"

The weakness of Savonius is the resistance in one blade side. Efforts to improve that has been done is to add a blade that serves to increase the local velocity of fluid flow to resist the resistance which is termed Savonius tandem blade (STB). This research was conducted to further reduce the resistance value of one side STB with the addition of an adjustable deflector. The purpose of this study is to obtain information on changes in the torque of the STB wind turbine on variations in the deflector angle and stream velocity. The research method used is numerical simulation using CFD software. A two-dimensional view of the rotor model using deflector was considered. The deflector angle varies start from 15 degrees with an increase also every 15 degrees until the torque decreased. The CFD simulation show there is a significant increase in torque with the addition of a deflector. Maximum torque is not achieved at one deflector angle value but is also influenced by stream velocity. At higher stream velocity there is a tendency to reach the maximum torque required larger deflector angle. Then at a certain point, the torque will decrease when the deflector angle is enlarged. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079817202"

The turbine is a novel hybrid Savonius-Darrieus combined rotor which aims optimizing performances in medium-low wind regimes, by using a careful design of the shape, size and relative positions of Savonius and Darrieus blades. To this end, a dynamically scaled turbine model is tested in wind tunnel to derive instantaneous and averaged velocity fields by means of Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), which allows deriving wakes and specific fluid flow phenomena on each single configuration (Savonius or Darrieus) and interactions on the combined geometry. These results are coupled with electrical measurements to determine global performances, efficiency and best working conditions for each separate turbine and for the combined turbine. Data are also compared with results obtained by other authors in previously reported combined hybrid configurations. The proposed system is able to work with good performances (power coefficient equal or slightly lower than 0.2), on an extended range of operative conditions, covering those of each component alone, i.e. for tip speed ratios between 0.5 and 4, in comparison to the ranges 0.5 ÷ 1 and 1.7 ÷ 4 of the used Savonius and Darrieus components.

The proposed methodology was first validated against the published wind tunnel test data. The best parameters were then used to evaluate the static performance of the four Savonius models.

The application of wind energy in industrial and household sectors is becoming increasingly attractive and widely extended to substitute the traditional oil-produced energy. This can also minimize the environmental pollution. Different types of wind turbine have been used for low as well as high power applications. Recently, an increased attention has been given to vertical axis wind turbine due to its simplicity and advantages over horizontal axis wind turbine. Savonius wind turbine is considered as one of the most popular types of vertical axis wind turbine due to its simplicity in design and operation for low power applications especially in low wind speed regions. Different design parameters of Savonius wind turbine have been previously investigated towards the best performance. However, the blade materials have not been considered previously in order to show its impact on Savonius wind turbine performance. In the present paper, the design and operation of Savonius wind turbine are investigated according to the local climate conditions in Taif-city, Saudi Arabia. Two different materials have been used for blade manufacturing, namely Aluminum sheets (3003) and PVC (ASTM D2665-14) materials. The effects of such materials on the performance of Savonius rotor related to its output power are experimentally investigated. It is found that, the blades made from Aluminum sheets showed better performance than those made from PVC material. In general, it is concluded that Savonius wind turbine can be used efficiently for household applications in Taif region, Saudi Arabia. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blade Material; Renewable Energy; Saudi Arabia; Savonius Wind Turbine; Taif City; Wind Energy","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173726128"

However, the conventional single-stage Savonius rotors have negative torque values at a certain range of rotor angles and large torque variation over the complete cycle which led to reduction of the power coefficient and the self-starting abilities. To overcome these drawbacks, a multi-stage Savonius wind rotor is proposed to obtain the optimum number of stages that enhances both the power coefficient and the self-starting capabilities. In the current study, one-, two-, three-, and four- stage Savonius wind rotors with straight semicircular blades are investigated. In two stages rotor, one single-stage rotor is mounted over another single stage with a phase shift of 90°. In the three stages rotor, the three singlestage rotors are mounted one above the other with a phase shift of 60° relative to one another while with a phase shift of 45° for the four stages. All rotors have overall rotor diameter (D) of 200 mm, a thickness of 2 mm, a stage aspect ratio of 1.0, and an overlap ratio (d) of 0.0. The diameter of the circular end plates (Do) attached to the rotor tips is 1.1 of the rotor diameter (D). All studies are performed at a wind speed (V) of 6 m/s. The variations of torque and power coefficients are estimated for all the studied multi-stages rotors. Therefore, 3D incompressible unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations along with the k-w shear-stress transport turbulence model is developed and numerically simulated using ANSYS Fluent. The numerical model is validated using the available measurements and numerical results. The predicted flow field characteristics such as streamlines and pressure fields around the studied rotors with various numbers of stages are presented and analyzed. Accordingly, results indicated that with the increase in the number of stages, a significant enhancement of the torque and the power coefficients is attained. In addition, the rate of percentage gain in the torque and the power coefficients is higher for two stages rotor than that of three and four stages rotors. The maximum torque and power coefficients for the two stages rotor are 0.336 and 0.194, respectively. The power coefficient gain obtained by using the two stages Savonius rotor is 17.5 % compared to the conventional single stage which has a power coefficient of 0.165 at a wind velocity (V) of 6 m/s. Furthermore, using a multi-stage rotor significantly smooths the variations in the torque coefficient and produces positive static torque values at all rotational angles resulted in enhancing the self-starting capabilities of the Savonius rotor. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aspect Ratio; Multi-stage Rotor; Savonius Rotor; Aspect Ratio; Shear Stress; Torque; Turbomachine Blades; Turbulence Models; Wind; Wind Turbines; Flow Field Characteristics; Power Coefficients; Savonius Wind Rotor; Shear-stress Transport; Stage Aspect Ratio; Torque Coefficient; Unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier-stokes Equations; Vertical Axis Wind Turbines; Navier Stokes Equations","Aspect ratio; Shear stress; Torque; Turbomachine blades; Turbulence models; Wind; Wind turbines; Flow field characteristics; Power coefficients; Savonius wind rotor; Shear-stress transport; Stage aspect ratio; Torque coefficient; Unsteady reynolds averaged navier-stokes equations; Vertical axis wind turbines; Navier Stokes equations","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101263677"

Although horizontal axis wind turbines (HAWTs) have proven to be effective in low turbulence and steady wind conditions, vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs) potentially have the advantage in highly variable and turbulent regions. The Savonius vertical axis wind turbine has several advantages such as simple design, low manufacturing costs, low operating wind speed, low noise, and Omni-directional capability. However, the Savonius rotor requires further design optimization to improve its aerodynamic performance before becoming competitive with other turbine designs. Thus, the main objective of the current study is to numerically investigate the aerodynamic performance of a multistage Savonius rotor to enhance the power coefficient and the ability of self-starting. In the current study, one-, two-, three-, and four- stage Savonius rotors with twisted blades are investigated. In a two-stage rotor, one single-stage rotor is mounted over another single- stage with a phase angle of 90°. In a three-stage rotor, the three single-stage rotors are mounted one above the other with a phase angle of 60° relative to one another while with a phase angle of 45° for the four stage-rotor. The blades of the studied Savonius rotor are twisted with a twist angle (f) of 45o. This is the first contribution to understand how multi-stages influence the aerodynamic performance of the twisted-bladed Savonius rotor. Moreover, variations of torque and power coefficients are computed for all the studied rotors with various numbers of stages. The developed numerical model is simulated using ANSYS Fluent and validated using the available experimental and numerical results. Results showed that the coefficients of torque (CT) and power (CP) increase with rising the number of stages. Increasing the number of stages from 1 to 2 significantly increases the CT and CP of the rotor. However, with a further increase in the number of stages to 3 and 4 stages, both the CT and CP remains almost the same as the rotor with 2 stages. The maximum coefficient of torque (CT, max) and power (CP, max) for a two-stage rotor are 0.42 and 0.253, respectively. The gain in the coefficient of power obtained by using the twostage Savonius rotor with twisted blades is 53.5% compared to the conventional single-stage which has a coefficient of power 0.165 at a wind velocity of 6 m/s. Moreover, using multi-stages and twisted blades significantly smooth the variations in the generated torque and produce positive values at all rotor angles resulted in improving the self-starting ability of the Savonius rotor. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aspect Ratio; Multi-stage Rotor; Twisted Savonius Rotor; Energy Policy; Manufacture; Torque; Turbomachine Blades; Wind; Wind Power; Wind Turbines; Aero-dynamic Performance; Coefficient Of Power; Coefficient Of Torques; Design Optimization; Horizontal Axis Wind Turbines; Manufacturing Cost; Power Coefficients; Vertical Axis Wind Turbines; Aerodynamics","Energy policy; Manufacture; Torque; Turbomachine blades; Wind; Wind power; Wind turbines; Aero-dynamic performance; Coefficient of power; Coefficient of torques; Design optimization; Horizontal axis wind turbines; Manufacturing cost; Power coefficients; Vertical axis wind turbines; Aerodynamics","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101253044"

Numerical computations are conducted for a single Savonius turbine, and for the five clustered turbines aligned in perpendicular direction with respect to the upstream wind velocity. The study is carried out using ANSYS FLUENT commercial code and the moving mesh approach for the rotating zones is used. The turbulence model adopted in this work is the k-ω shear stress transport (SST) model. Numerical approach was first validated with previously published experimental and numerical data for a single rotating Savonius rotor case with semi-circular blades. Then, an improvement process based on the modification of the blades profiles to an elliptical shape was adopted. Subsequently, the change in distance between the five vertical Savonius rotors « Gap» has been considered with values of 0.25, 1 and 1.4 times the rotor radius (R). Results show that the Gap = 1R provides the optimum power coefficient for the wind farm rotors. However, the generated wake zone behind the five aligned rotors for this value is more important in particular for the 90 ° angle of the advanced and returned rotor blades. The field efficiency defined by the total power ratio of the five isolated rotors to the total power of the wind farm with five Savonius rotors is around 67%.

Hydropower installed in Indonesia is only 11,272 MW, from the estimated potential approximately 94,476 MW. This data shows that 89% of the hydropower potential in Indonesia has not been processed. One of the present efforts to utilize this resource is addressed to develop the Savonius water turbine. Conventional water Savonius turbines have a comprehensible structure and easy to be applied. However, the turbines produce relatively small power, which requires further assessment to improve its performance. The current study is performed by considering geometric changes on the water Savonius turbine to observe their effect on power characteristics. Considered changes are made on the number of stages, and the angle between stages, specifically a single-stage, two-stage 0°, Two-stage 90°, three-stage 0°, and three Stage 120°. The research was carried out by designing simulation model using ANSYS software with CFX Solver.

The experiment on the AWG test stand was set up for different Blade Thickness (BT), t=0.9 mm, 1.2 mm, 1.5 mm, and 2.0 mm where BT that has higher RPM will be the best rotor. The total of 4 test runs of passenger car installed with AWG was conducted using the best BT of the rotor. From the test run conducted on the highway road, the overall functionality of rotor and output voltage have been observed. The apparatus test stand requires verification with actual test run on passenger. On the other word, only the best BT with high RPM will be continued for further test stand for charging capability. Comparison of test stand and test run on passenger car show the blade with a thickness of 0.9mm as the optimum blade thickness.

The energy requirement is increasing because of the exponential population rise, increased industrial activities, and subsequent accelerated economic activities in both urban and suburban areas. The traditional power sources are becoming unsustainable as energy demand and induction of new sources for augmenting the energy need are lopsided. Additionally, traditional energy sources cause pollution, natural hazards, and more importantly, it is uneconomical. Due to these reasons, it becomes compelling to look for alternative sources of energy. Hydropower generation is reliable, non-polluting to a large extent, and a cheaper source of electrical energy. However, the conventional large hydropower projects, especially with reservoir components, are being opposed worldwide for social, environmental, economic, and safety reasons. Therefore, electricity production from free-flowing water may present a viable choice. Here, the free-flowing river water current is used to drive vertical-axis turbines preferably, Savonius rotors which are ideally built for wind energy conversion systems (WECS). The rotor is directly coupled to electric generators, and the scheme presents a typical variable voltage and variable frequency system similar to that of WECS except that the working force is due to water rather than wind. The use of the Savonius rotor for hydrokinetic power generation is uncommon; however, increased exploitation of this methodology may help in augmenting future energy need. This paper reviews the Savonius rotor and its possible application for hydrokinetic power generation; the merits and demerits of such schemes are clearly outlined. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Alternative Energy Sources; Energy Conversion Systems; Extraction Of Energy From Hydroenergy Using Savonius Turbine; Renewable Energy; Economics; Energy Conversion; Flow Of Water; Hydroelectric Power; Reservoirs (water); River Pollution; Wind Power; Alternative Sources Of Energy; Electricity Production; Hydro-power Generation; Industrial Activities; Technological Advancement; Urban And Suburban Areas; Vertical Axis Turbines; Wind Energy Conversion System; Hydroelectric Power Plants","Economics; Energy conversion; Flow of water; Hydroelectric power; Reservoirs (water); River pollution; Wind power; Alternative sources of energy; Electricity production; Hydro-power generation; Industrial activities; Technological advancement; Urban and suburban areas; Vertical axis turbines; Wind energy conversion system; Hydroelectric power plants","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092144461"

Rotors are located one above the other. Their shafts are coaxial. The shaft of one Savonius rotor carries the rotor of an electric generator, and the shaft of the other carries the stator of the same generator. Savonius rotors are supposed to rotate in opposite directions. Thus, the relative angular speed of the generator rotor with respect to the stator is increased. The generator is connected to the local electrical circuit. Operation modes corresponding to autorotations of Savonius rotors in the wind flow are discussed. The trapped power in such regimes is estimated. It is shown that the chosen design of the wind turbine is characterized by the same maximum power coefficient as a classical single Savonius rotor, but with double increase of the relative angular speed of the generator rotor with respect to the stator.

Up until now, to improve the output power coefficient, the newly developed Savonius rotor with semi-elliptical sub-buckets has been introduced. However, some of the parameters on the semi-elliptical bucket have not yet been properly determined. Therefore, the influence of the additional semi-elliptical bucket's shape in the newly developed Savonius rotor on the output power coefficient was investigated. The flow around the rotor was simulated by using the regularized lattice Boltzmann method. The virtual flux method was used to describe the shape of the rotor on Cartesian grids, and the multi-block method was used for the local fine grids around the rotor. The rotational speed of the Savonius rotor was maintained as a constant, and its performance was evaluated by the output power and torque coefficients. As a result, the additional semi-elliptical bucket successfully generated a positive torque during the advancing bucket period. While, it did not generate a large negative torque during the returning bucket period owing to its position behind the main bucket in the wind flow direction. Through a cycle, the semi-elliptical bucket only generated a positive torque with the interaction of the main bucket. The output power coefficient of the newly developed Savonius rotor was improved when compared to that of the traditional or Bach-type ones. The maximum output power coefficient of the newly developed Savonius rotor was 50.7% higher than that of the traditional rotor and 16.9% higher than that of the Bach-type rotor. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Additional Semi-elliptical Bucket; Bach-type Savonius Rotor; Savonius Rotor; Tip Speed Ratio; Torque Coefficient; Vertical Axis Wind Turbine","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087073455"

The abundant availability of water flow in Indonesia makes hydropower an alternative new energy source that is easily developed, one of which is research on water turbines.

The foremost motive of this study is to widen the operating wind speed range of the counter-rotating concept in a VAWT while enhancing the conversion efficiency of a single-rotor VAWT system. The 3D simulations were performed based on the K-omega shear stress transport (SST) turbulence model.

Thus, modifying the configuration of the rotor may be an effective solution for providing electricity to the communities with no access to the power grid. Thus, this investigation aims to study numerically the effect of adding two inner blades on the performance of the Savonius wind rotor at low tip speed ratios (TSRs).

Therefore, a combination of time step and time increment for one wind speed may not work for other wind speeds. A CFD sensitivity analysis of a Savonius rotor is conducted in this study in order to improve its simulation accuracy in predicting the rotor rotational speed by manipulating the time step for a wind speed range of 2–6 m/s. An optimum combination of time step and time increment for minimum error for first are obtained by CFD analysis. Based on a reference parameter of 6 m/s wind speed, other time step for 2, 3, 4 and 5 m/s wind speeds were calculated using the number of revolutions required to reach a steady state rotational speed. The resulted rotational speeds generated were then compared with the actual experiment in an open circuit wind tunnel. It is observed that the rotor only starts to rotate just after zero-time step and gradually accelerates until it reaches a constant rotational speed. Consequently, higher time step is required for low speeds and the converse is true for the high speeds. Lower time step can result in non-convergence solution. The result shows that the predicted RPM of Savonius rotor can be made close to the experimental data at the expense of higher computing time. Accuracy of predicted RPM is within 5% as compared to 20% without sensitivity analysis. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Flow-driven; Savonius; Sensitivity Analysis; Time Step; Computational Fluid Dynamics; Speed; Wind Speed; Wind Tunnels; Flow-driven; Rotational Speed; Rotor Rotational Speed; Savonii; Savonius Rotor; Simulation Accuracy; Time Increments; Time Step; Time-constants; Sensitivity Analysis","Computational fluid dynamics; Speed; Wind speed; Wind tunnels; Flow-driven; Rotational speed; Rotor rotational speed; Savonii; Savonius rotor; Simulation accuracy; Time increments; Time step; Time-constants; Sensitivity analysis","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075714101"

The latter type of basin helps in the re-construction of vortex once it is distorted after passing through a runner and thus, provide an additional potential for power extraction at different heights along the basin. In the absence of a detailed experimental study on multi-staging of GWVT in a conical basin, a preliminary investigation has been carried out using runners of Savonius type blades and producing power independently because of telescopic shafts arrangement. The effects of crucial design parameters such as rotor diameter to basin diameter ratio (RB), vortex-blade interaction, the position of the various stages and the offset distance between the neighboring stages, on the performance of GWVT are reported. In addition, the performance parameters which include rotational speed, torque and power are investigated under various rotor submergence conditions; thus, revealing maximum performance for a brimming vortex-blade interaction. One of the key findings of the study is the complex transfer of energy between the two neighboring stages through the vortex flow without the physical contact of rotors. Moreover, multi-staging provides more power than single-stage GWVT by strengthening the vortex in the vicinity of each other through rigid body rotation of the neighboring runners. The outcomes of the present study make it a potential benchmark for the future generations of GWVT technology. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conical Basin; Gravitational Water Vortex Turbine; Multi-stage; Performance Parameters; Rotors Ratio; Vortex-blade Interaction; Energy Transfer; Hydraulic Turbines; Conical Basin; Conical Configuration; Design Parameters; Different Heights; Future Generations; Multi Stage; Performance Parameters; Rigid Body Rotation; Vortex Flow; Design Method; Diameter; Experimental Study; Gravity Field; Rotation; Submergence; Torque; Turbine; Vortex Flow; Water Technology; Elagatis","Energy transfer; Hydraulic turbines; Conical basin; Conical configuration; Design parameters; Different heights; Future generations; Multi stage; Performance parameters; Rigid body rotation; Vortex flow; design method; diameter; experimental study; gravity field; rotation; submergence; torque; turbine; vortex flow; water technology; Elagatis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070307272"
